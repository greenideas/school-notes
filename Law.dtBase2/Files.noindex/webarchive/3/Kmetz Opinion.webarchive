    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ORDER OF ADMONITION</font>
  </center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> THIS MATTER came on to be heard 
  on December 14, 2001 before a panel of the Disciplinary Board consisting of 
  Randy Ira Bellows, Esq., Panel Chair, Robert L. Freed, Esq., Joseph R. Lassiter, 
  Jr., Esq., H. Taylor Williams, IV, Esq., and Chester J. Cahoon, Jr. The Virginia 
  State Bar (hereinafter referred to as the "Bar") was represented by Paul Georgiadis, 
  Assistant Bar Counsel. The respondent, Michael Denis Kmetz, was present and 
  represented by Andrew A. Protogyrou, Esquire and J. Barry McCracken, Esquire. 
  Catherine M. K. Blalock, Chandler &amp; Halasz, Registered Professional Reporters, 
  P. O. Box 9349, Richmond, VA 23227, 804-730-1222, recorded the hearing. The 
  chair polled the panel to determine whether any member had any business or financial 
  interest or any personal bias that would impair or could be perceived to impair 
  his ability to hear this matter fairly and impartially. Each member, including 
  the chair, responded in the negative. The three cases were heard separately 
  on the issue of whether misconduct had occurred, with separate deliberations 
  and findings following the evidence and argument in each case. </font></p>

    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FINDINGS</font>
  </center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A. <u>Procedural History</u></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Respondent is charged with committing 
  deliberately wrongful acts in three cases involving three unrelated clients. 
  All three allegations of misconduct involve the purported fabrication of letters 
  to the clients after the fact to establish that notification of decisions by 
  appellate courts was communicated to clients in a timely manner. The three complaints 
  of misconduct were filed by Respondent's clients in July, 1999 (Madison), December, 
  1999 (Powell), and January, 2000 (Landry). A subcommittee of the district committee 
  was convened on June 27, 2001, and certified all three cases to the Disciplinary 
  Board. Paul D. Georgiadis, Assistant Bar Counsel, represented the Bar before 
  the subcommittee and the Board. The certifications were served on Respondent 
  July 16, 2001. On September 25, 2001, the Bar notified Respondent that the cases 
  would be heard on December 14, 2001. A pre-hearing order was issued by the chair 
  of the panel on September 28, 2001. On October 19, 2001, Respondent retained 
  Andrew A. Protogyrou, Esquire, to represent him. Mr. Protogyrou moved for a 
  continuance due to an anticipated scheduling conflict. The motion was denied 
  by order entered October 30, 2001. J. Barry McCracken was associated as co-counsel 
  by Respondent and Mr. Protogyrou and both he and Mr. McCracken appeared on behalf 
  of Respondent at the hearing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The panel convened on December 14, 
  2001, to hear evidence in the three cases. The Bar moved to consolidate the 
  three cases for hearing, in which case evidence on all three alleged offenses 
  would be presented together. The Respondent asked that each case be heard separately. 
  The panel held that the three offenses had been certified separately by the 
  Second District Committee (Section I), no motion had been filed by the Bar to 
  consolidate the cases for hearing, nor had consolidating the cases been addressed 
  at the pre-hearing conference held on September 25, 2001. Nor did the Bar file 
  a motion to have the evidence from one proceeding admitted in the other proceedings 
  as "similar acts" evidence. The motion to consolidate, therefore, was denied.</font></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br wp="BR2">
</font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B. <u>VSB Docket No. 00-021-1782 
  (Complainant: Holly M. Landry)</u></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br wp="BR2">
  </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Respondent was court-appointed to 
  defend Holly M. Landry ("Landry"), who was charged with capital murder. Following 
  her conviction and imposition of a life sentence by the Circuit Court of the 
  City of Norfolk, Respondent was appointed on December 2, 1997, to represent 
  Landry on appeal. Respondent timely filed appeals to the Court of Appeals and 
  the Supreme Court of Virginia, which were denied August 4, 1998, and October 
  29, 1998, respectively. Landry wrote the Bar on January 12, 2000 (Board Ex. 
  1), claiming that Respondent was not answering her letters, that she had only 
  just learned on January 6, 2000, that her appeal to the Supreme Court had been 
  denied in October, 1998, and that her time to file a <em>habeas corpus</em> 
  petition had expired.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Landry alleged that she could prove 
  Respondent's failure to keep her informed because the prison keeps a record 
  of all of her legal mail. By letter to bar counsel dated March 5, 2000, Mr. 
  Kmetz responded to Ms. Landry's allegations (Bar Ex. 3). Respondent noted that 
  he handled both appeals and appeared before the Supreme Court to argue for a 
  writ of error, which was denied in October, 1998. He stated in his letter that 
  he forwarded a copy of the opinion to Landry within a day or two of receiving 
  it, and that the letter was never returned to his office by the postal service. 
  He further stated that he received a call from Landry's counselor at Fluvanna 
  Correctional Facility in October, 1999, and advised her that the petition for 
  a writ had been denied by the Supreme Court. Respondent asserted that the evidence 
  against Landry was overwhelming, and that it was only through his efforts that 
  the Commonwealth's efforts to seek the death penalty were thwarted. By letter 
  dated March 13, 2001 (Bar Ex. 2), Respondent furnished bar counsel with copies 
  of two letters dated August 6, 1998 (Bar Ex. 2) and November 3, 1998 (Bar Ex. 
  2). These two letters form the crux of the case: the Bar contends that they 
  were fabricated by Respondent to disprove Landry's claim that she never received 
  notice that her appeal had been denied.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Respondent's August 6, 1998 letter 
  purports to transmit to Landry a copy of the Court of Appeals decision denying 
  her Petition for Appeal, and advising her that he would appeal the denial to 
  the Supreme Court. The November 3, 1998 letter purports to enclose a copy of 
  the Supreme Court's decision denying her petition for appeal, advising her of 
  her <em>habeas corpus</em> rights and confirming that Respondent no longer represents 
  her. The parties stipulated that Landry would have testified that she did not 
  receive the two letters in question. (Bar Ex. 4). The parties further stipulated 
  that on or about September 15, 2001, Landry did receive an envelope addressed 
  to her at Fluvanna that had copies of transmittal letters to the clerks of both 
  courts, presumably notices of the petition for a writ filed with the Supreme 
  Court after the Court of Appeals denied her appeal. (Bar Ex. 4).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> On or about June 4, 1998, Landry 
  was transferred from the Virginia Correctional Center for Women in Goochland 
  ("Goochland") to Fluvanna. (Bar Ex. 4). Respondent's letters of August 6, 1998 
  and November 3, 1998 were addressed to Goochland. Charlene Parish, mailing supervisor 
  at Goochland, testified that she personally retrieved the mail from the post 
  office in Goochland each morning and sorted it at the correctional center. All 
  mail from attorneys, courts or the Virginia State Bar ("legal mail") is date 
  stamped, logged in, and taken to the inmates by the evening shift supervisor. 
  Two to six bins of mail are received by Goochland each day. Parish agreed on 
  cross examination that Goochland receives "tens of thousands" of pieces of legal 
  mail a year, but testified on redirect that Goochland receives two to seven 
  pieces a day. Inmates are not infrequently transferred from one correctional 
  facility to another. "Legal mail" sent to an inmate at Goochland who has been 
  transferred to another facility is returned to sender. On the other hand, non-legal 
  mail, which is not logged in, is forwarded to the inmate at the current facility 
  to which he or she may have been transferred.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The critical issue is whether the 
  letters in question were fabricated, and the key defect in the Bar's contentions 
  is the lack of corroborating evidence to establish that the letters were fabricated. 
  First, there are no inherent inconsistencies within the four corners of the 
  documents which suggest that they are fabricated. Second, there are a number 
  of explanations as to what may have happened to the letters, which would not 
  constitute fabrication: (1) Respondent gave the letters to his secretary but 
  she failed to mail them; (2) the postal service failed to deliver the letters 
  to Goochland and failed to return them to Respondent; (3) the letters arrived 
  at Goochland and were treated as regular mail, not logged in, and forwarded 
  to Landry, who received them but does not admit receiving them; (4) the letters 
  were forwarded to Landry and lost in forwarding. Third, the Board did not have 
  before it an independent review by the Bar of Respondent's file, which might 
  have been helpful, even if not dispositive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It is well established that, in 
  misconduct proceedings, the Bar has the burden of proof and it must carry that 
  burden by "clear and convincing" evidence. <u>See</u> Disciplinary Board Rule 
  of Procedure IV(D)(9)(A). In this case, as stated above, the critical issue 
  is whether the letters were fabrications. Given the absence of clear and convincing 
  evidence that the letters were indeed fabrications, the Board finds that the 
  charges of misconduct, specifically allegations of violations of DR 6-101 and 
  DR 2-108 of the Virginia Code of Professional Responsibility, and Rule 8.4 of 
  the Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct, must be deemed unproven.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C.<em> </em><u>VSB Docket No: 00-021-1276 
  (Complainant: James C. Powell)</u></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br wp="BR2">
  </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The second matter involves the appeal 
  of a civil case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
  Once again, the case turns on a letter written by Respondent to the client, 
  advising the client of the decision in the case. This time the letter was written 
  to the correct address; however, the client testified that the letter was not 
  received.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Respondent, who did not try the 
  case in the federal district court, was retained by James C. Powell to handle 
  the appeal. Respondent filed the appellate brief on or about December 21, 1998. 
  Powell, a Norfolk police officer, testified that he communicated with Respondent's 
  receptionist, by telephone or by stopping by the office, monthly, from February 
  17, 1999, to August 25, 1999. On September 7, 1999 he scheduled an appointment 
  for September 28. 1999, but that morning the receptionist called for Respondent 
  to cancel the appointment. He again spoke to the receptionist on October 13, 
  1999, his call was not returned, and when Powell called again on October 27, 
  1999, at 10:15 a.m., Powell testified that Respondent happened to answer the 
  telephone. Respondent informed him that his appeal had been denied on June 8, 
  1999, and Powell came in to pick up his file at 2:15 p.m. the afternoon of October 
  27, 1999. Contained in the file which Powell picked up from Respondent's office 
  on October 27, 1999, was a copy of a letter from Respondent dated June 8, 1999, 
  purporting to transmit to Powell a copy of the Fourth Circuit opinion denying 
  his appeal, and advising Powell of his right to petition either the appellate 
  court for a rehearing <em>en banc</em> or the Supreme Court of the United States 
  for a <em>writ of certiorari</em>. The copy of the letter from the Fourth Circuit 
  transmitting the opinion to Respondent was date stamped "June 8, 1999", and 
  the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed that the opinion was mailed June 
  8, 1999. Respondent's letter transmitting the opinion to Powell was also dated 
  June 8, 1999, an impossibility. However, Respondent testified that his receptionist 
  must have failed to advance the date stamp when she stamped the morning mail, 
  and that when he typed the transmittal letter to the client, he probably picked 
  up the erroneous date off of the opinion itself or the erroneous date stamp. 
  Powell testified that the first time he saw the June 8, 1999 letter was when 
  he picked up his file on October 27, 1999. However, when Powell filed his complaint 
  with the Bar in January, 2000, he alleged that he did not learn of the existence 
  of the letter denying the appeal until January 10, 2000. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> An investigation of Respondent's 
  computer was conducted by the Bar. Kmetz testified that the hard drive on the 
  computer that he used to prepare the June 8th letter (and the letter in Madison, 
  below) crashed some time after June 8, 1999 and he purchased a new computer 
  in May, 2000. The old computer was given to his paralegal. There was no server 
  at the time. There were no backups. The investigation failed to reveal any pertinent 
  information which would tend to prove or disprove fabrication of the letters 
  in question.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The panel finds that the Bar has 
  failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the June 8, 1999 letter 
  was fabricated by Respondent. Respondent claims to have mailed the letter and 
  Powell's testimony does not establish by clear and convincing evidence either 
  that the letter was never mailed or that it was a fabrication.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  </font>
</p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There is nothing within the four 
  corners of the letter to suggest that it was fabricated, other than the erroneous 
  date, which was explained. Respondent's file was not introduced, so the panel 
  does lack some context in which to judge the June 8, 1999 letter. Having failed 
  to establish that the letter was fabricated, it follows that the allegation 
  of a violation of Rule 8.4 of the Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct must 
  be deemed unproven. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> However, Respondent is also charged 
  with failure to keep the client informed. Respondent denied communicating with 
  Powell on any occasion from December 21, 1998, when he mailed the appellate 
  brief to Powell until October 27, 1999, when respondent picked up his file, 
  other than his contention that he mailed the opinion to Powell on June 8, 1999. 
  Powell contends that he communicated with Respondent's office monthly; Respondent 
  denies that such communications occurred. Powell contends that he talked to 
  Respondent on the morning of October 27, 1999, Respondent contends that Powell 
  talked to his secretary.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The panel finds by clear and convincing 
  evidence that one communication from December 21, 1998 to October 27, 1999, 
  in the context of this proceeding, was insufficient to keep his client reasonably 
  informed about the matter for which the lawyer's services had been retained. 
  Therefore, we find the Respondent to have violated DR 6-101(C). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D. <u>VSB Docket No: 00-021-1013 
  (James Lamont Madison)</u> The third case also involved a criminal appeal. Once 
  again, the critical issue in the case involves the alleged transmittal to the 
  client of the opinion denying an appeal by letter dated July 15, 1998. Respondent 
  was appointed to represent James Lamont Madison on December 4, 1997, by the 
  Norfolk Circuit Court to handle his criminal appeal. On June 11, 1998, Madison 
  was transferred from Southampton Reception and Classification Center to Brunswick 
  Correctional Center, where he was on July 15, 1998. On July 13, 1998, the Court 
  of Appeals denied his appeal, and Respondent allegedly transmitted the decision 
  to him by letter dated July 15, 1998, correctly addressed to Brunswick. The 
  letter was never received by Madison, and never logged in as legal mail by Brunswick. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Once again, as in the other two 
  matters, the Board weighed the evidence in this case without reliance upon, 
  or reference to, the facts established in the other matters. Given that the 
  Bar bears the burden of proving its allegation by clear and convincing evidence 
  and given the Respondent's representation that the letter was in fact sent to 
  Madison on July 15, 1998, <u>see</u> VSB Exhibit 3, and given the presumption 
  afforded by the "mailbox rule", we find that the Bar has failed to carry its 
  burden. We recognize that the complainant would testify that he did not receive 
  the letter and that the Brunswick Correctional Center does not have a record 
  of the letter having been received. Those two facts alone, however, do not establish 
  by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent fabricated the letter and 
  then made false statements to the Bar to hide his failure to notify the complainant 
  of the denial of his appeal. Therefore, we find that the Bar has not proven 
  violations of DR 6-101 of the Virginia Code of Professional Responsibility and 
  Rule 8.4 of the Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct.</font></p>
<p>
  </p><center>
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DETERMINATION OF SANCTION</font>
  </center>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Respondent testified that he became 
  a licensed attorney in New Jersey in 1985 and entered active duty in 1986. Between 
  1986 and 1991 he served as a Navy JAG and, for a period of time prior to 1991, 
  served as a Special Assistant United States Attorney in the Office of the United 
  States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 
  In 1991, Respondent was admitted to the Virginia State Bar. He has no prior 
  disciplinary record. The obligation to keep a client "reasonably informed about 
  matters in which the lawyer's services are being rendered," <u>see</u> DR 6-101, 
  is a fundamental requirement in the practice of law. A failure to comply with 
  these requirements has potential serious adverse consequences for the client 
  and warrants discipline. Because this is the Respondent's first finding of misconduct, 
  the panel finds that the appropriate sanction is an admonishment. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It is FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk 
  of the Disciplinary System shall send an attested copy of this Order to the

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="N_1_">1. </a> In this connection, 
  it is worth noting that the law traditionally affords litigants a presumption 
  arising out of evidence that a particular item was mailed. The "mailbox rule" 
  has been characterized as follows: "It is presumed, in the absence of evidence 
  to the contrary, that a notice mailed to an individual in the ordinary course 
  of business was received by that individual. This presumption arises when it 
  appears from the record that the notice was properly addressed and duly mailed. 
  The appearance of a properly addressed copy in the case record, together with 
  the mailing custom or practice of the Office itself, will raise the presumption 
  that the original was received by the addressee." <u>Lepre v. Department of 
  Labor</u>, 275 F.3d 59, 62 (C.A.D.C. 2001). Here we have a copy of the letter 
  and the Respondent's representation that it was mailed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="N_2_">2. </a> Respondent's 
  work history is not typically a part of the written record submitted to the 
  Board prior to a hearing, and it was not a part of the written record in this 
  case. When Respondent disclosed during his testimony that he had been assigned 
  as a Navy JAG to be a Special Assistant United States Attorney in the Eastern 
  District of Virginia (which would have been at some point between 1986 and 1991), 
  the panel chair, who is a current Assistant United States Attorney in the Eastern 
  District of Virginia, immediately stopped the proceedings to advise the parties 
  of his present employment and asked each party whether it objected to the chair's 
  service on the panel. Neither the Bar nor the Respondent objected. </font>
