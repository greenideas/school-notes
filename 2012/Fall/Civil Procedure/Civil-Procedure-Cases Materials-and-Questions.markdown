# Civil Procedure: Cases, Materials, and Questions

## Personal Jurisdiction
* *Subject matter jurisdiction* - whether a court has jurisdiction to hear a particular kind of case (e.g. probate, family law, small claims, etc.)
* *Personal jurisdiction* - whether a court may assert authority over a party.
* *Injunctive relief* - Plaintiff gets a decision that prohibits another party from doing something (schools may not segregate, the seller of some property must transfer that property in accordance with a contract)
* When a plaintiff is awarded monetary damages, it is the responsibility of that plaintiff to seek enforcement of that judgment.
* Full Faith and Credit clause of Article IV requires that every state enforce judgments of every other state.
	* States where gambling is illegal must still enforce judgments based on gambling contracts in other states.
	* The one exception to FF&C is if the court making the judgment is found to not have personal jurisdiction over the defendant.

### Pennoyer v. Neff
SCOTUS 1878, J. Field

* **Parties**
	* Marcus Neff, owed legal fees to Mitchell
	* Sylvester Pennoyer,  purchased Neff's land from Mitchell

* **Facts**
	* Neff owed $253.14 in legal fees to Mitchell
	* Neff owned land in Oregon
	* Neff resided in California
	* Notice of the suit was published for six weeks in the Pacific Christian Advocate
	* Mitchell executed Neff's property in Oregon & purchased it himself at auction
	* Mitchell transferred the property to Pennoyer

* **Procedural History**
	* Mitchell sued Neff in Oregon state court to recover the legal fees
	* The state court in Oregon gave a default judgment against Neff
	* Neff sued Pennoyer for the return of his land.
	* Trial court said the judgment in *Mitchell v. Neff* was incorrect
	* Trial court said Mitchell's affidavit inadequately stated the steps taken to locate Neff
	* Court found for Neff
	* Pennoyer appealed to SCOTUS

* **Issue**
	* Did the Oregon court have in personam jurisdiction over Neff

* **Rule**
	* A state court only has jurisdiction over a person if that person resides in that state, is currently physically in that state, or owns property in that state.
		* Jurisdiction due to property extends only to the property itself.
	* If one party is not located in a state (no in personal jurisdiction), property in that state must be attached at the beginning of the lawsuit in order to establish in rem jurisdiction. (p.26)

* **Holding**
	* The land could not be brought under control of the state without proper notice and proper notice was not given.

* **Reasoning**
	* If notice of a suit didn't have to be in person, and the judgment could also be executed without the defendant present, people could be sued without ever knowing it was happening. 
	* Proceedings in rem, in a general enough sense, are really proceedings involving people.

* **Notes**
	* *ex parte* - Judgment rendered without all parties present
	* *in personam* - Judgment directed at a particular person
	* *in rem* - Judgment directed at a thing
	* *coram non judice* - Before one who is not a judge -- improper venue
	* Service of process - Presentation of a summons and a complaint
	* Constructive service - Service by publication. A party is assumed by law to have knowledge of something regardless of whether they actually do.
	* Two kinds of in rem case:
		1. Those concerning ownership of the property in question
		2. Those in which the property is used only to establish jurisdiction (quasi-in-rem)
	* Had Mitchell used quasi-in-rem to secure Neff's property, the default would have been valid
	* To do this, Mitchell would have had to attach the land at the start of the litigation.

### Hess v. Pawloski
* SCOTUS, 1927, J. Butler
* PA driver is in an accident on an MA public highway
* Consent statutes for individuals

* **Parties**
	* Hess injured Pawloski with a motor vehicle on a public highway in MA
	* Pawloski

* **Facts**
	* Hess injured Pawloski with a motor vehicle on a public highway in MA
	* Hess is a resident of PA
	* MA law states that by driving on their roads, the registrar of the commonwealth becomes a legal representative of the driver, so process may be served on the registrar in the absence of the driver.

* **Procedural History**
	* Hess came to MA to dispute that jurisdiction (special appearance) & lost in MA court.
	* The MA Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision.
 
* **Issue**
	* Does the MA rule about serving process violate 14th Amendment right to due process?

* **Reasoning**
	* The purpose of the statute is to allow MA residents to sue nonresidents who use MA roads and is not discriminatory.
	* Consent to the application of jurisdiction is implied by using MA roads.

* **Holding**
	* Affirmed. Holding of the state supreme court is upheld, and the jurisdiction over Pawloski is valid.

* **Notes**
	* Privileges & immunities clause of Article IV - States can't abridge the privileges and immunities conferred on citizens by the US gov't. In Hess, it's used to show that a state can't discriminate against the citizens of other states.
	* "Appearing specially" - coming to court to contest jurisdiction without thereby consenting to jurisdiction.
	* Using "Presence" (Pennoyer) and "Consent" (Hess) as criteria to establish jurisdiction were replaced by "doing business"
	* Today, we can dispute jurisdiction at the same time as the facts of the case, so the special appearance is no longer used.
	* Agency - vesting a second party to act as the legal representative of the first party.
	* Special appearance - appearance before the court solely to dispute jurisdiction

### International Shoe Co. v. Washington
* SCOTUS, 1945, J. Stone

* **Parties**
	* International Shoe Co. - A DE corporation, located in MO, doing business in WA
	* State of WA

* **Facts**
	* WA requires businesses operating in that state to pay into an unemployment compensation fund.
	* ISC did not pay into that fund.
	* The law establishing that fund says that the WA Commissioner may collect outstanding payments by service notice to the business if it's located in WA or by sending registered mail to the last known address of the business.
	* Notice was served to an ISC salesman in WA & mailed to the company in MO.
	* ISC said they were not a WA corporation and not an employer in the state of WA, and so were not subject to the compensation scheme.
	* ISC has no production facilities in WA and has no sales offices there.
	* ISC *did* employ salesmen in WA and those salesmen did work in WA.
	* ISC maintains this did not constitute presence in WA

* **Procedural History**
	* WA state court ruled that the WA Commissioner was entitled to collect.
	* Affirmed by WA Superior & Supreme Courts.
	* ISC in each court argued that the compensation law violated the due process clause of the 14th amendment and was a burden on interstate commerce.
	* SCOTUS rejects argument about interstate commerce noting that other states have unemployment insurance funds structured like WA's.
 
* **Issue**s
	* Can WA claim jurisdiction over a DE corporation doing business in WA without violating the 14th Amendment?
	* Can WA extract compensation from that company without violating the 14th Amendment?

* **Holding**
	* Affirmed.

* **Reasoning**
	* ISC did enough interstate business in WA that it "enjoys the benefits and protections of the laws of that state" and is so obligated to abide by those laws.

* **Dissent**
	* J. Black

### McGee v. International Life
* SCOTUS, 1957
* Life ins. co. in TX refused to pay a claim on behalf of policy holder in CA.
* Ins. co. sent certificate of reinsurance to policy holder in CA, & he sent his premiums to TX. **Transactions in both directions**
* SCOTUS found that CA could claim jurisdiction.
* Due process was satisfied since the contract (e.g. policy) had "substantial connection" with CA
* CA has an interest in providing legal recourse to its citizens when insurance companies refuse their claims.
* The witnesses in such cases will usually be in the state where the insured lived.

### Hanson v. Denckla
* SCOTUS, 1958
* Dora Donner was a PA domiciliary.
* She created a trust in DE, with a DE bank as the trustee.
* Donner moved to FL & designated recipients of the trust.
* While in FL, Donner sent money to DE, but DE never did any business in FL. **One-way transaction**
* *probate* - determining beneficiaries of a will & disbursing assets accordingly.
* Donner's will was probated in FL.
* Benificiaries of the trust & those of the will got into a legal dispute.
* FL law said that the DE bank needed to be a party to the suit.
* SCOTUS determined FL had no jurisdiction over the DE bank.
* DE bank did not conduct business in FL. It didn't "avail[] itself of the privilege of conducting activities there," and so didn't "invok[e] the benefits and privileges of [FL's] laws." It was thus not subject to FL's jurisdiction.

### Gray v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp.
* State courts largely based jurisdiction on *McGee* and mostly ignored *Hanson*.
* A safety valve was manufactured in OH & sold to a PA company that used it in a water heater.
* The water heater was sold to Gray in IL where it exploded.
* Gray sued the valve manufacturer (Titan Valve Co.)  in IL.
* SCOTUS upheld IL's jurisdiction over the OH company, even though they had only transacted directly in PA.
* Titan benefited from the protection of IL's laws, since the PA company selling water heaters in IL allowed Titan to sell more valves.
* Increasing specialization in the marketplace means that fewer companies will directly transact with the states in which their products are ultimately used.
* The use of a product in a particular state is sufficient contact to establish jurisdiction.
* Manufacturers must be accountable for damage caused by their products in any state in which those products are used.
* New transportation technology makes it easier to travel to court in other states, lowering that burden.
