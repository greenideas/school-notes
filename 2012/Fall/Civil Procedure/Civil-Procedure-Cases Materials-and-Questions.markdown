# Civil Procedure: Cases, Materials, and Questions

## Personal Jurisdiction
* *Subject matter jurisdiction* - whether a court has jurisdiction to hear a particular kind of case (e.g. probate, family law, small claims, etc.)
* *Personal jurisdiction* - whether a court may assert authority over a party.
* *Injunctive relief* - Plaintiff gets a decision that prohibits another party from doing something (schools may not segregate, the seller of some property must transfer that property in accordance with a contract)
* When a plaintiff is awarded monetary damages, it is the responsibility of that plaintiff to seek enforcement of that judgment.
* Full Faith and Credit clause of Article IV requires that every state enforce judgments of every other state.
	* States where gambling is illegal must still enforce judgments based on gambling contracts in other states.
	* The one exception to FF&C is if the court making the judgment is found to not have personal jurisdiction over the defendant.

### Pennoyer v. Neff
SCOTUS 1878, J. Field

* **Parties**
	* Marcus Neff, owed legal fees to Mitchell
	* Sylvester Pennoyer,  purchased Neff's land from Mitchell

* **Facts**
	* Neff owed $253.14 in legal fees to Mitchell
	* Neff owned land in Oregon
	* Neff resided in California
	* Notice of the suit was published for six weeks in the Pacific Christian Advocate
	* Mitchell executed Neff's property in Oregon & purchased it himself at auction
	* Mitchell transferred the property to Pennoyer

* **Procedural History**
	* Mitchell sued Neff in Oregon state court to recover the legal fees
	* The state court in Oregon gave a default judgment against Neff
	* Neff sued Pennoyer for the return of his land.
	* Trial court said the judgment in *Mitchell v. Neff* was incorrect
	* Trial court said Mitchell's affidavit inadequately stated the steps taken to locate Neff
	* Court found for Neff
	* Pennoyer appealed to SCOTUS

* **Issue**
	* Did the Oregon court have in personam jurisdiction over Neff

* **Rule**
	* A state court only has jurisdiction over a person if that person resides in that state, is currently physically in that state, or owns property in that state.
		* Jurisdiction due to property extends only to the property itself.
	* If one party is not located in a state (no in personal jurisdiction), property in that state must be attached at the beginning of the lawsuit in order to establish in rem jurisdiction. (p.26)

* **Holding**
	* The land could not be brought under control of the state without proper notice and proper notice was not given.

* **Reasoning**
	* If notice of a suit didn't have to be in person, and the judgment could also be executed without the defendant present, people could be sued without ever knowing it was happening.
	* Proceedings in rem, in a general enough sense, are really proceedings involving people.

* **Notes**
	* *ex parte* - Judgment rendered without all parties present
	* *in personam* - Judgment directed at a particular person
	* *in rem* - Judgment directed at a thing
	* *coram non judice* - Before one who is not a judge -- improper venue
	* Service of process - Presentation of a summons and a complaint
	* Constructive service - Service by publication. A party is assumed by law to have knowledge of something regardless of whether they actually do.
	* Two kinds of in rem case:
		1. Those concerning ownership of the property in question
		2. Those in which the property is used only to establish jurisdiction (quasi-in-rem)
	* Had Mitchell used quasi-in-rem to secure Neff's property, the default would have been valid
	* To do this, Mitchell would have had to attach the land at the start of the litigation.

### Hess v. Pawloski
* SCOTUS, 1927, J. Butler
* PA driver is in an accident on an MA public highway
* Consent statutes for individuals

* **Parties**
	* Hess injured Pawloski with a motor vehicle on a public highway in MA
	* Pawloski

* **Facts**
	* Hess injured Pawloski with a motor vehicle on a public highway in MA
	* Hess is a resident of PA
	* MA law states that by driving on their roads, the registrar of the commonwealth becomes a legal representative of the driver, so process may be served on the registrar in the absence of the driver.

* **Procedural History**
	* Hess came to MA to dispute that jurisdiction (special appearance) & lost in MA court.
	* The MA Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision.
 
* **Issue**
	* Does the MA rule about serving process violate 14th Amendment right to due process?

* **Reasoning**
	* The purpose of the statute is to allow MA residents to sue nonresidents who use MA roads and is not discriminatory.
	* Consent to the application of jurisdiction is implied by using MA roads.

* **Holding**
	* Affirmed. Holding of the state supreme court is upheld, and the jurisdiction over Pawloski is valid.

* **Notes**
	* Privileges & immunities clause of Article IV - States can't abridge the privileges and immunities conferred on citizens by the US gov't. In Hess, it's used to show that a state can't discriminate against the citizens of other states.
	* "Appearing specially" - coming to court to contest jurisdiction without thereby consenting to jurisdiction.
	* Using "Presence" (Pennoyer) and "Consent" (Hess) as criteria to establish jurisdiction were replaced by "doing business"
	* Today, we can dispute jurisdiction at the same time as the facts of the case, so the special appearance is no longer used.
	* Agency - vesting a second party to act as the legal representative of the first party.
	* Special appearance - appearance before the court solely to dispute jurisdiction

### International Shoe Co. v. Washington
* SCOTUS, 1945, J. Stone

* **Parties**
	* International Shoe Co. - A DE corporation, located in MO, doing business in WA
	* State of WA

* **Facts**
	* WA requires businesses operating in that state to pay into an unemployment compensation fund.
	* ISC did not pay into that fund.
	* The law establishing that fund says that the WA Commissioner may collect outstanding payments by service notice to the business if it's located in WA or by sending registered mail to the last known address of the business.
	* Notice was served to an ISC salesman in WA & mailed to the company in MO.
	* ISC said they were not a WA corporation and not an employer in the state of WA, and so were not subject to the compensation scheme.
	* ISC has no production facilities in WA and has no sales offices there.
	* ISC *did* employ salesmen in WA and those salesmen did work in WA.
	* ISC maintains this did not constitute presence in WA

* **Procedural History**
	* WA state court ruled that the WA Commissioner was entitled to collect.
	* Affirmed by WA Superior & Supreme Courts.
	* ISC in each court argued that the compensation law violated the due process clause of the 14th amendment and was a burden on interstate commerce.
	* SCOTUS rejects argument about interstate commerce noting that other states have unemployment insurance funds structured like WA's.
 
* **Issue**
	* Can WA claim jurisdiction over a DE corporation doing business in WA without violating the 14th Amendment?
	* Can WA extract compensation from that company without violating the 14th Amendment?

* **Holding**
	* Affirmed. Due process for jurisdiction is satisfied by the extent of the party's contact with the state and the relationship between that contact and the content of the suit.

* **Reasoning**
	* ISC did enough interstate business in WA that it "enjoys the benefits and protections of the laws of that state" and is so obligated to abide by those laws.

* **Dissent**
	* J. Black
	* Centers on 'fair play & substantial justice'
	* 'doing business' is no better defined in the Constitution than 'fair play' or 'substantial justice'

### McGee v. International Life
* SCOTUS, 1957
* Life ins. co. in TX refused to pay a claim on behalf of policy holder in CA.
* Ins. co. sent certificate of reinsurance to policy holder in CA, & he sent his premiums to TX. **Transactions in both directions**
* SCOTUS found that CA could claim jurisdiction.
* Due process was satisfied since the contract (e.g. policy) had "substantial connection" with CA
* CA has an interest in providing legal recourse to its citizens when insurance companies refuse their claims.
* The witnesses in such cases will usually be in the state where the insured lived.

### Hanson v. Denckla
* SCOTUS, 1958
* Dora Donner was a PA domiciliary.
* She created a trust in DE, with a DE bank as the trustee.
* Donner moved to FL & designated recipients of the trust.
* While in FL, Donner sent money to DE, but DE never did any business in FL. **One-way transaction**
* *probate* - determining beneficiaries of a will & disbursing assets accordingly.
* Donner's will was probated in FL.
* Benificiaries of the trust & those of the will got into a legal dispute.
* FL law said that the DE bank needed to be a party to the suit.
* SCOTUS determined FL had no jurisdiction over the DE bank.
* DE bank did not conduct business in FL. It didn't "avail[] itself of the privilege of conducting activities there," and so didn't "invok[e] the benefits and privileges of [FL's] laws." It was thus not subject to FL's jurisdiction.

### Gray v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp.
* State courts largely based jurisdiction on *McGee* and mostly ignored *Hanson*.
* A safety valve was manufactured in OH & sold to a PA company that used it in a water heater.
* The water heater was sold to Gray in IL where it exploded.
* Gray sued the valve manufacturer (Titan Valve Co.)  in IL.
* SCOTUS upheld IL's jurisdiction over the OH company, even though they had only transacted directly in PA.
* Titan benefited from the protection of IL's laws, since the PA company selling water heaters in IL allowed Titan to sell more valves.
* Increasing specialization in the marketplace means that fewer companies will directly transact with the states in which their products are ultimately used.
* The use of a product in a particular state is sufficient contact to establish jurisdiction.
* Manufacturers must be accountable for damage caused by their products in any state in which those products are used.
* New transportation technology makes it easier to travel to court in other states, lowering that burden.

### World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson
* SCOTUS 1980, J. White

* **Parties**
	* π: World-Wide Volkswagen 
	* ∂: Woodson

* **Facts**
	* Robinsons bought an Audi in NY & passed through OK on their way to move to AZ.
	* While in AZ, the Audi was rear-ended, which caused it to catch fire & severely burn Mrs. Robinson & her two children.
	* WWVW was incorporated & had its offices in NY 
	* WWVW & Seaway have only contractual connection with Audi & VW.
	* Neither WWVW nor Seaway sells or advertises anything in OK or has any agent to receive process there.

* **Procedural History**
	* Robinsons sued Audi (mfr), VW of America (importer), World-Wide VW (regional distributor), & Seaway (retailer) in OK.
	* Audi & VW of America didn't contest personal jurisdiction.
	* VW of America & Seaway put in special appearances saying that giving OK jurisdiction over them would go against 8th amendment due process
	* District ct. rejected the 8th amendment claim
	* WWVW sought a writ of prohibition from OK Supreme Court to keep District Judge Woodson from exercising personal jurisdiction.
	* WWVW argued (again) that due process was violated since they didn't have minimal contacts in the state
	* OK Supreme Ct. said jurisdiction was valid under OK's "long-arm" statute
	* OK Supreme Ct.: Given the retail value of a car, WWVW probably gets substantial income from cars that are sometimes used in OK.
	* SCOTUS granted cert.

* **Issue**
	* Can a state claim in personam jurisdiction over a nonresident manufacturer and a nonresident distributor for a product sold in another state, when that product causes injury in the first state.

* **Reasoning**
	* Requiring minimum contact for personal jurisdiction does two things:
		1. Protects defendant from having to litigate in distant, inconvenient forums.
			* "fair play and substantial justice"
			*  fairness has to be balanced against: 
				* the interest of the state in adjudicating the suit (like CA ensuring its citizens can sue insurance companies, *McGee*)
				* the plaintiff's interest in getting speedy, convenient relief
				* the interstate judicial system's interest in resolving conflicts efficiently
				* the states' interests in furthering policy
		2. Ensures that states don't encroach upon the sovereignty of coequal states.
	* Technological & economic change are forcing the loosening of 8th amendment restrictions.
	* The lower bound on loosening 8th amendment due process is interstate federalism.
	* Foreseeability is too low a bar for minimum contact
	* Due process needs to give potential defendants predictability in where they might expect to be sued and allow them to structure their conduct accordingly. 

* **Holding**
	* Appellant did not have minimum contact with OK--no personal jurisdiction

* **Rule**
	* Due process needs to give potential defendants predictability in where they might expect to be sued and allow them to structure their conduct accordingly
 
* **Dissent**
	* J. Brennan
	* *Forseeability*
		* States interests in adjudicating were strong (witnesses were there, it was their highway system they want to keep safe, etc.)
		* An automobile by its nature is directly inserted into interstate commerce.
		* A car gets a lot of its value from the highway system, which is comprised of roads in each state that maintains them, so a car dealer in NY really does benefit from the laws of OK
	* *Defendants' rights/convenience*
		* "Orderly administration of the laws" is as much an argument in favor of plaintiffs' and states' interests as it is for defendants'.
	* Brennan's standard for asserting jurisdiction: If the forum state has an interest in the case and there's nothing unfair about that jurisdiction besides distance and borders, presumption should be in favor of granting jurisdiction.

### Personal Jurisdiction in Federal Court
* A federal district court generally only has personal jurisdiction if the state courts in which the fed court is located could do so. Rule 4(k)(1)(A)
	* *Exceptions*
		* A federal statute specifically authorizes it--"nationwide service of process" Rule 4(k)(1)(C)
		* The claim is based on federal law **and** jurisdiction is constitutional **and** there is no state that can claim personal jurisdiction. Rule 4(k)(2)
			* *Graduate Management Admissions Council v. Raju* - D did not have a substantial connection with any one state, but did so have with the US as a whole
* Nationwide service of process falls under 5th amendment due process instead of 14th amendment

### *Keeton* and *Calder*
* In *Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.*, Keeton, a NYer, sued Hustler for libel in NH because it was the only state in which the statute of limitations of her libel had not run. 
* Her claim was based on damage to her reputation in NH as well as nationwide.
* Plaintiff doesn't need any connection with the forum state.
* NH jurisdiction over Hustler was still limited to the extent of its activities in NH	
* In *Calder v. Jones* SCOTUS affirmed CA's award of personal jurisdiction for similar reasons.
* P & D were both in FL, but D was a TV entertainer whose career was based in CA.
* P published a defamatory article in CA (among other states) that could have harmed D's career. This was enough of a connection to CA to award jurisdiction.
* Based on the connection between the content of the article and the location of D's career, P could "reasonably anticipate being haled into court there"

### Why Litigants Care About Where Litigation Occurs
* If jurisdiction isn't granted in one state, it doesn't mean litigation won't proceed against D, since it will likely be granted somewhere.
* Thus any costs to D for litigation outside of where D is domiciled will only be the additional costs for litigating elsewhere
* Main reason litigants care about venue is the particular laws of the forum state.
* A state with no connection to the parties or activity in the cause of action cannot apply its laws *even if it has personal jurisdiction*--that state can adjudicate, but must apply the law of whatever state has those connections.

### Asahi Metal Industry Co. Ltd v. Superior Court of California, Solano County (Cheng Shin Rubber Industrial Co, Ltd, Real Party in Interest)
* SCOTUS 1987, J. O'Connor

* **Parties**
	* π: Asahi Metal Industry Co. Ltd
	* ∂:  Superior Court of California, Solano County (Cheng Shin Rubber Industrial Co, Ltd, Real Party in Interest)

* **Facts**
	* Zurcher, riding his motorcycle in CA with his wife as passenger, lost control of the motorcycle and hit a tractor.
	* Zurcher was seriously injured & his wife was killed.
	* Zurcher claimed the rear tire was defective and sued for product liability in CA

* **Procedural History**
	* Suit for product liability re: the rear tire was brought in CA against Cheng Shin (Taiwanese tube mfr.), among others.
	* Cheng Shin countersued for indemnification from codefs & from Asahi, the mfr of the tube's valve assembly.
	* Zurcher settled with Cheng Shin.
	* Only remaining question was Cheng Shin's indemnification claim against Asahi
	* CA's long-arm allows jurisdiction whenever it is constitutional in CA & US.
	* Asahi argued jurisdiction would violate 14th amendment.
	* Asahi argued:
		* It is a Japanese corp.
		* It mfrs tire valve assemblies in JP and sells them to Cheng Shin (& other tire mfrs)
		* Sales occurred in TW.
		* Shipments were from JP to TW.
		* Tires were mfrd in TW.
		* 20% of Cheng Shin's US sales are in CA.
		* Cheng Shin gets valves from companies other than Asahi and sells tubes globally.
	* In one store in Solano County, 21 of 115 tubes had Asahi valves. 12 of those were Cheng Shin tubes.
	* Cheng Shin employee swore in an affidavit that Asahi knew its valves would end up in CA.
	* Pres of Asahi swore an affidavit saying it never contemplated where its valves would end up after TW such that it could anticipate being sued in CA.
	* CA Ct. of App. denied Asahi's motion for dismissal of summons saying it's reasonable for an int'l mfr to expect to be sued int'lly.
	* CA Supreme Ct. reversed, saying Asahi had no office, property or agent in CA, & does no business directly in CA.
	* Neither did Asahi establish the distribution channel by which its valves ended up in CA.
	* Still CA Supreme Ct. *did* say that jurisdiction was not a 14th amendment violation since Asahi knew its valves would end up in tubes in CA & it indirectly benefitted from CA business.
	* CA Supreme Ct. thought that intentionally placing valves into the market plus the knowledge that some valves would end up in CA was sufficient for jurisdiction under 14h amendment Due Process.
	* SCOTUS granted cert.

* **Issue**
	* Does a foreign firm's awareness that products it manufactures, sells, and delivers outside of the US will end up in a US state constitute "minimum contacts" for the purpose of establishing personal jurisdiction.

* **Reasoning**
	* "Minimum contacts" is still the bar for judging whether jurisdiction passes muster with 14th amendment due process
	* Minimum contacts have to be established through actions initiated by the D himself.
	* From *Volkswagen*, it's not sufficient for minimum contact for the customer to have brought the product in the cause of action into the forum state.
	* Some courts say putting a product into the stream of commerce is enough, while others say the introduction of the product must be directed at the forum state.
	* The CA Supreme Ct's reasoning was along the former line--i.e., putting a product into the stream of commerce & hence making lawsuits "foreseeable" is enough for personal jurisdiction.
	* The latter interpretation of *Volkswagen* is correct. That is, D's activity must be directed at the forum state in order to satisfy due process.
	* Asahi, though it put its valves into the market, didn't: advertise in CA, do customer support in CA, have salespeople in CA, etc., and so didn't establish minimum contact with CA.
	* Reasonableness of jurisdiction depends on:
		* Burden to the defendant
		* Interests of the forum state
		* Plaintiff's interest in obtaining relief
		* Judicial system's interest in efficiency
		* The shared interest of all states in fulfilling their policy goals
	* Addressing these in turn:
		* High burden for Asahi--long distance, foreign judicial system.
		* CA has little interest here.
		* Cheng Shin didn't prove why it should litigate in CA instead of TW or JP.
		* Both judicial efficiency & states' policy goals are served by balancing the burden on the plaintiff and the interests of the forum state. Presumption should be be against bringing foreign D's into state cts.
		* Int'l context, heavy burden on D, & little state interest collectively go against due process.

* **Holding**
	* Minimum contact requirement is not met, so awarding personal jurisdiction goes against fair play and substantial justice.
 
* **Concurrence**
	* *Part II-B--Rehnquist, Brennan, White, Marshall, Blackmun, Powell, Stevens*
		* Don't agree with II-A's assertion that Asahi didn't purposefully avail itself of the CA mkt.
		* Putting products into the mkt without any additional effort directed at a forum state is sufficient for jurisdiction as long as other factors don't undercut due process.
		* Litigation is a burden, but it has attendant benefits.
		* Do agree that fair play & substantial justice are harmed by granting jurisdiction here. 
		* Minimum contact requirement *is* met, but jurisdiction goes against due process for other reasons.
	* *Part II-A and III--Rehnquist, Powell, Scalia*
	* *Part I and II-B--Stevens, White, Blackmun*
		* Two problems with II-A
			1. It's unnecessary for the ct's decision--minimum contact need not always be established to determine constitutionality of jurisdiction.
			2. Ct's finding in II-B that jurisdiction would be "unreasonable & unfair" is enough to say it's unconstitutional. If jurisdiction violated fair play & substantial justice, that trumps whatever activity occurs in the forum state.

### J. McIntyre Machinery vs. Nicastro
* SCOTUS 2011, J. Kennedy

* **Parties**
	* π: J. McIntyre Machinery - British scrap metal machine nfr
	* ∂: Nicastro - NJian, injured by JMM machine

* **Facts**
	* Nicastro injured his hand using a JMM metal shearer in NJ.
	* Machine mfrd in UK.
	* JMM had a US distributor for its machines & sold some to that distributor on consignment
	* JMM appeared next to the distributor at trade shows in the US (but not NJ)
	* JMM encouraged distributor to sell machines anywhere in the USA
	* No more than 4 JMM machines in NJ at the time of the accident.
	* JMM had US & EU patents on its machine
	* Distributor advertised under the direction of JMM
	* JMM never owned property in, sent reps to, or paid taxes in NJ.

* **Procedural History**
	* Nicastro sued JMM in NJ trial ct.
	* NJ Supreme ct held that NJ cts could claim jurisdiction over a foreign mfr if "knows or reasonably should know that its products are distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead to those products being sold in any of the fifty states"
	* SCOTUS granted cert.

* **Issue**
	* Can a state ct claim jurisdiction over a foreign company that has never shipped goods nor marketed to that state?

* **Reasoning**
	* Generally neither laws nor judges can assert authority over parties not connected to the state.
	* Contact between state & foreigner must be sufficient for jurisdiction not to offend "fair play and substantial justice" *International Shoe*
	* Foreigner must avail itself of the benefits & protections of forum state's laws. *International Shoe*, *Hanson*
	* Unless the foreigner deliberately attempts to evade a state's laws.
	* Domicile, presence at time of service, or consent are traditionally how jurisdiction is established.
	* *International Shoe* introduced the standard of a party availing itself of the benefits & protections of forum state's laws
	* *World-Wide Volkswagen* introduced the standard of putting goods in the stream of commerce knowing they would end up in the forum state (though the standard wasn't met in that case)
	* Sending goods instead of agents only counts when the goods are targeted at the forum state
	* *Asahi* introduced the idea (in Brennan's concurrence--not the opinion) that putting goods into the stream of commerce was sufficient as long as the mfr knew they would end up in the forum state--foreseeability
	* O'Connor's opinion in *Asahi* said that putting goods in the stream of commerce was not, by itself, enough of a connection with the forum state
	* Expectations are insufficient for jurisdiction--there must me action
	* Fairness isn't the standard. Otherwise opinions would take into account difficulty in a plaintiff appearing in a foreign venue or defendants' interests could replace a lack of purposeful availment.
	* Two principles here:
		1. There must be sufficient activity directed at a forum
			* Jurisdiction is there to protect individual liberty--not the power of the State
		2. A D may be subject to the jurisdiction of the US but not to any one state
			* Jurisdiction protects states from encroaching on the power of other states
	* Foreseeability is too low a bar. Can't sue local farmers in FL for veggies sold locally to a distributor & re-sold in AK.
	* JMM *did* purposefully direct its products & marketing to the US.
	* NJ has a strong interest on protecting its citizens from defective machinery, but that's not enough by itself.

* **Holding**
	* "Stream-of-commerce" doctrine is insufficient for personal jurisdiction. Foreign company must direct its activity toward the state such that it benefits from that state's laws. *Hanson*
 
* **Concurrence**
	* Breyer, joined by Alito
	* Does selling a product on Amazon constitute directed activity? A pop-up ad a mfr knows will be seen in a particular forum? Plurality didn't address that.
	* There's a rule established without enough thought to the consequences.
	* Could've & should've overturned jurisdiction based on precedent alone.
	* The promiscuous jurisdiction that NJ suggests would require a mfr to be familiar with the product liability laws of any state in which it could foresee its goods being sold.

* **Dissent**
	* Ginsburg, joined by Sotomayor, Kagan
	* Majority will let foreign mfr launder their death machines of liability by selling them through a distributor (me: but isn't the distributor liable? and if so, isn't there a disincentive for mfrs to make poorly constructed death machines since distributors wouldn't buy them?)
	* *International Shoe* should be the standard ("fair play and substantial justice")
	* NJ should have specific jurisdiction over the injury, which did happen there.
	* Plurality's decision rests on implied consent, which has been dismissed as being sufficient for jurisdiction since *International Shoe* (*Burger King* grants jurisdiction when consent was not given)
	* Presence, doing business, and consent, are all outmoded as ways of establishing jurisdiction.
	* The fact that choice-of-law and litigational convenience are factors in decisions shows that fairness & reasonableness is the de facto standard
	* More fair to make JMM come to NJ than to make Nicastro go to Nottingham
	* Audi, the mfr in *WWVV*, *did not* object to OK jurisdiction & in dicta, the court said it wouldn't have worked if they had tried.
	* *Asahi* doesn't control here, since it was a case about a transaction between two foreign companies, and Asahi had never made any effort to sell its valve assemblies in the US

### General Jurisdiction
#### Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown
* SCOTUS 2011, J. Ginsburg

* **Parties**
	* π: Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A.
	* ∂: Brown

* **Facts**
	* Bus accident outside Paris killed 2 13-year-old NC boys.
	* Bus had a defective tire mfrd at a Goodyear plant in Turkey.
	* Plant was a subsidiary of Goodyear USA
	* Foreign subsidiaries market to Europe & Asia and their tires are different sizes & shapes than US tires.
	* Subsidiaries' tires did make it into NC via an organized distribution process.
	* The tire the caused the accident met US DoT standards & had appropriate markings to be sold in the US.

* **Procedural History**
	* Parents sued in NC ct, Goodyear USA (an OH corp), and 3 of its subsidiaries in Turkey, Luxembourg, and France.
	* Goodyear USA has plants in NC & didn't contest jurisdiction there.
	* Foreign subsidiaries all contested jurisdiction.
	* NC ct of appeals said NC had general jurisdiction over Goodyear's foreign subsidiaries since some of their tires came to NC in the stream of commerce.
	* NC ct of appeals claimed that NC had an interest in providing a forum for suit.

* **Issue**
	* Is a foreign corporation subject to general jurisdiction in a forum where its goods end up via the stream of commerce?

* **Reasoning**
	* General jurisdiction requires that D's connection with the forum state be "consistent and systematic" to the point that D is effectively home there.
	* Specific (case-linked) jurisdiction requires that the cause of action be related to the forum state. Adjudication may only cover issues that established jurisdiction.
	* Accident was in France & tires were mfrd & sold outside NC, so NC doesn't have specific jurisdiction.
	* NC ct of appeals was wrong. "Stream of commerce" != "consistent & systematic"
	* Due process reqs that D have minimum contacts & that the suit doesn't offend standards of fair play & substantial justice. *Shoe*
	* Jurisdiction is  obviously valid when D's activity in the forum state is "continuous and systematic" and the cause of action is a consequence of that activity 
	* For "single or occasional acts," specific jurisdiction may be valid if the cause of action stems from that activity.
	* Only twice between 1945 (*Shoe*) & 2011 (*Goodyear*) has the court considered general jurisdiction for out-of-state corps, and only once granted it.
	* Stream of commerce is never sufficient for general jurisdiction.
	* Can't say (as NC cts did) that a corp is subject to general jurisdiction anywhere its goods happen to end up.

* **Holding**
	* Unanimous(!) No, a foreign corporation may only be subject to general jurisdiction in a forum with which they have consistent & systematic contact.

#### Shaffer v. Heitner
* SCOTUS 1977, J. Marshall

* **Parties**
	* π: Shaffer
	* ∂: Heffner

* **Facts**
	* DE law lets state assert jurisdiction in a lawsuit by attaching any of ∂'s property located in DE.
	* Heitner, a DE nonresident, owned one share of stock in Greyhound, which is incorporated in DE but headquartered in AZ.
	* Heitner sued a Greyhound, a wholly owned Greyhound subsidiary & 28 present & former officers & directors in DE in a shareholder derivative suit alleging that their behavior opened the corps being liable for substantial damages under antitrust litigation & a large fine in a criminal contempt action.
	* The activities the suit alleged occurred in OR.
	* Heitner filed a sequestration order against a bunch of Greyhound stock.
	* The court sequestered 82,000 shares of common stock belonging to 19 of the ∂s and options belonging to another 2 ∂s.
	* The actual paper was not located in DE but the notional stock was.
	* ∂s were notified of the suit via certified mail & publication in a DE newspaper

* **Procedural History**
	* Appellants made a special appearance to contest the service of process and remove the sequestration saying ex parte sequestration violated due process & the seized property couldn't be attached in DE.
	* Appellants argued that they didn't have sufficient contacts with DE for it to assert jurisdiction. *Shoe*
	* DE Court of Chancery said the law authorizing the sequestration, which had the explicit purpose of bringing nonresident defendants into the state, was generally temporary, and that the purpose & duration of the sequester satisfied due process.
	* DE Ct. of Ch. also held that the notional presence of the stock in DE was sufficient for quasi in rem jurisdiction.
	* DE Supreme Ct. affirmed. saying that since the proceedings were initiated under quasi in rem, minimum contacts were irrelevant.
	* The 14th amendment is agnostic about in personam vs. in rem judgments.

* **Issue**
	* Does the "fair play and substantial justice" standard apply to in rem jurisdiction as well as in personam?

* **Reasoning**
	* π claims DE law violates 14th amendment due process because it:
		* lets the state assert jurisdiction without any connection between ∂, the controversy, and the state.
		* authorizes the taking of property without sufficient procedural safeguards
	* SCOTUS will only look at this first question.
	* **Argument for applying the "fair play & substantial justice" standard to in rem**
		* Jurisdiction over a thing is really just shorthand for jurisdiction over a person's interest in that thing.
		* Therefore, the same standard should be applied to jurisdiction over a thing as would be applied to jurisdiction over a person's interest in that thing.
		* That standard is the minimum contact requirement of *International Shoe*
	* Absent minimal contacts, courts have used the presence of property to establish jurisdiction in cases since ∂ shouldn't be able to get out of paying a judgment by moving his assets out of state.
	* However, that justification can't explain why property is used to establish jurisdiction in cases where there's no attempt to evade judgment. 
	* Also, even if that were a valid reason for asserting jurisdiction, it still wouldn't grant jurisdiction over the underlying claim.
	* FF&C allows enforcement in any state of judgments made in whatever state may claim in personam jurisdiction over ∂ anyway.
	* In cases where existence of minimum contacts is unclear we wouldn't want to assert jurisdiction anyway, since doing so would violate "fair play & substantial justice"
	* **IV**
		* DE's legislature has asserted no interest in adjudicating derivative suits involving corporations domiciled (incorporated) there

* **Holding**
	* Minimum contacts are required for in rem jurisdiction just as they are for in personam.

### Jurisdiction Over Corporations and Partnerships
* While in-state service of a transient individual is sufficient for jurisdiction, in-state service of a transient corporate agent is not.
* Service of an agent is based on consent, but not consent to general jurisdiction. That would be too high a burden.
* Whether the actions of a parent company subject a subsidiary to jurisdiction in a forum (or vice versa) must be determined on a case-by-case basis.
* While a corporation is effectively a person, a partnership is not itself an entity separate from the partners.

#### Revell v. Lidov
* 5th Circuit 2002, HIgginbotham

* **Parties**
	* π: Revell
	* ∂: Lidov

* **Facts**
	* Lidov wrote an article alleging conspiracy among Reagan administration officials to allow the Lockerbie bombing to occur
	* The article specifically picked out, Revell who was Associate Deputy Director of the FBI at the time.
	* Revell lived in TX.
	* Lidov lived in MA.
	* Columbia (with whom Lidov has no affiliation) is in NY.

* **Procedural History**
	* Revell sued Lidov for defamation regarding an article Lidov posted on a forum at Columbia.
	* Revell sued Columbia in NY and Lidov in TX.
	* District ct. dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction.
	* Revell appealed.

* **Issue**

* **Reasoning**
	* π said jurisdiction over Columbia was valid since the website advertised the Columbia Journalism Review which was sold in TX
	* Sliding scale for involvement of a website with a forum. *Zippo*
		* On one end is a totally passive site that doesn't engage with users in a forum. No PJ here.
	* Doing business *with* TX != doing business *in* TX.
	* On the other is a website whose owners frequently interact with users in a forum. PJ applies here.
	* Number of periodical sales to TX was very low.
	* Bulletin board was "*Zippo*-passive" so no specific jurisdiction.
	* π argued that the *Calder* effects test established minimum contacts with TX, since that's where he lived & that's where his reputation was harmed.
		* Article didn't mention TX & was not targeted specifically to TX readers.
		* Other precedent for the π's location not mattering for a *Calder* test.
	* From *Burger King*, ∂ should be able to expect being sued anywhere that can claim PJ over him. This test fails for ∂ since he didn't even know π lived in TX.
	* Knowing where π's harm will occur is necessary for a *Calder* test.
	* *If* there was a geographic focus to Lidov's attack, it was DC.
	* We look to the geographic focus of the article--not the bite of the defamation.

* **Holding**
	* Affirmed. No personal jurisdiction.

### Statutory Limits on Personal Jurisdiction
* "long-arm" statutes allow states to assert personal jurisdiction over nonresidents under certain conditions (that vary state-to-state)

## Notice and Opportunity to be Heard
### Notice
#### The Constitutional Requirement
##### Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co.
* SCOTUS 1950, J. Jackson

* **Parties**
	* π: Mullane
	* ∂: Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co.

* **Facts**
	* NY law allows the consolidation of trusts into a large centrally administered fund. This diversification mitigates risk and minimizes management overhead.
	* ∂ created such a fund. 113 trusts, $3M
	* ∂ gave notice of the creation of the fund by publishing an announcement in the local paper in compliance with NY banking law
	* Announcement didn't name any of the beneficiaries of the trust.
	* When the first investment was made into the common fund on behalf of each individual trust, the beneficiaries were notified individually by mail

* **Procedural History**
	* NY Ct. of Appeals

* **Issue**
	* Is notice of a proceeding involving many parties published in a local newspaper sufficient for 14th amendment due process?

* **Reasoning**
	* To meet the 14th amendment requirement for due process, notice of a proceeding has to:
		1. convey enough information about the proceedings so that parties can object; and
		2. allow enough time to respond
	* Method of delivering notice has to be the most likely feasible way of successfully doing so.
	* Publication doesn't meet this requirement
	* Nobody is going to see notice published in a newspaper--especially people who aren't local
	* Beneficiaries' appointed representatives (trustees) are actually the adversaries here.
	* Successful notice to most (but not all) beneficiaries would be just as good as notice to all, since all beneficiaries would benefit from the increased stability of the fund due to the majority's objections
	* Notice here is insufficient because it couldn't hope to reach even most of the beneficiaries.h

* **Holding**
	* The proceedings deprived πs of property rights, but notice of those proceedings by publication in a local newspaper was inadequate for those whose addresses were known (reversed). For those whose addresses were not known, publication of notice was sufficient (affirmed) 

* **Rule**
	* Notice has to be reasonably likely to reach parties and to allow them to object.
	
#### Statutory Requirements
##### National Dev. Co. v. Triad Holding Corp
* 2nd Cir 1991, Circuit Judge McLaughlin

* **Parties**
	* π: National Dev. Co.
	* ∂: Triad Holding Corp.

* **Facts**
	* Khashoggi while having residences all over the world, was domiciled in Saudi Arabia.
	* π delivered notice to Khashoggi's NY apt housekeeper.

* **Procedural History**
	* District ct. said service of process at Khashoggi's apartment in NY was sufficient 

* **Issue**
	* Was notice delivered at a foreign national's NY residence sufficient to meet due process requirements? 

* **Reasoning**
	* District ct. said apt wasn't a "dwelling house or usual place of abode" but that "actual notice" was served.
	* Actual notice was *not* served,  but apt really was a "dwelling house"
	* Housekeeper was of "suitable age & discretion" to receive notice
	* These days, people have more than one "dwelling house"
	* K didn't have a "usual place of abode" since he wasn't at any of his houses for very long.
	* K put a lot of money into making the NY apt suitable to his taste & listed it as a residence on a bail application.
	* The case law supports the conclusion that, when someone has a lot of residences, you may serve process on them at whichever residence in which they are currently living.

* **Holding**
	* Affirmed. Notice at the NY apt was sufficient.

* **Rule**
	* When someone has a lot of residences, you may serve process on them at whichever residence in which they are currently living.

## Subject Matter Jurisdiction
### State Courts and General Subject Matter Jurisdiction
* States are free to create as many different kinds of courts as they want
* The aggregate of all of the subject matter courts will have general subject matter jurisdiction (i.e. will be able to hear any kind of case)
* Admiralty, bankruptcy, patent & copyright, and antitrust & securities litigation will all occur solely in federal court.

### Federal Courts and Limited Subject Matter Jurisdiction
* Article III of the Constitution establishes the federal courts
* Jurisdiction of federal courts is not to the full extent allowed by the Constitution, but rather within limits imposed by Congress

### Plaintiff's Burden to Establish Federal Subject Matter Jurisdiction
* Parties can't grant jurisdiction to federal courts by consent
* Federal case can be dismissed at *any* point along the way if federal court is found to not have subject matter jurisdiction at which point π has to start the case over again in state court
* Presumption is against federal jurisdiction
* π has to prove federal jurisdiction is valid

### Diversity of Citizenship & Alienage Jurisdiction
* Founders gave federal court original jurisdiction over cases involving aliens in order to show foreigners that the US took such matters seriously & wouldn't leave them up to state courts (Art. III)
* Diversity of citizenship jurisdiction is meant to avoid home field advantage

#### Strawbridge v. Curtiss
* SCOTUS 1806, Marshall
* All πs have to be from a different state as all ∂s -- Complete Diversity Rule

### Determining Citizenship of Individuals
#### Mas v. Perry
* 5th Cir. 1974, Ainsworth

* **Parties**
	* π: Mas - Husband was French citizen, Wife was from MS
	* ∂: Perry - landlord

* **Facts**
	* 28 USC § 1332 gives original jurisdiction in diversity of citizenship or alienage cases where more than $10k (now it's $75) is at stake
	* Mases rented an apt from Perry in Baton Rouge

* **Procedural History**
	* Jury awarded Mr. Mas $5k & Mrs. Mas $15k in damages after finding that Perry had a two-way mirror in their apt.
	* At trial, Perry moved to dismiss saying ct lacked jurisdiction.
	* Dist. ct. denied. 

* **Issues**
	1. Did district ct. here properly uphold original jurisdiction?
	
* **Reasoning**
	* Perry was a LA citizen, Mr. Mas was French, and Mrs. Mas was a MS citizen, therefore diversity of citizenship.
	* The citizenship that counts for jurisdiction is the citizenship of the parties at the  time the complaint is filed.
	* Citizenship in a state requires: (1) US citizenship and (2) domicile in that state
	* Living somewhere as a student isn't sufficient to establish domicile
	* The amounts of money required to establish original Federal jurisdiction are the amounts asked for in good faith by the plaintiffs. If the final judgments are less than the required amount, that doesn't invalidate jurisdiction.
	* If Fed ct. has jurisdiction relating to one spouse's action against a defendant relating to a transaction, it should have jurisdiction relating to the other spouse's action relating to the same transaction.

* **Holding**
	* Yes. Diversity of citizenship was established.

### Determining Citizenship of Entities
* Businesses may be either corporate or non-corporate
* No legislation for citizenship of non-corporate entities (e.g. unions, LLCs, ins. assns., joint ventures, & partnerships)

#### Corporations
* Corporations are their own entities over & above the people who work there.
* Limited liability - if a corp. commits a tort, breaches contract, it is liable rather than any of the employees.

#### Randazzo v. Eagle-Pitcher Industries, Inc.
* Fed. Dist. Ct. 1987

* **Parties**
	* π: Randazzo
	* ∂: Eagle-Pitcher Industries, Inc.

* **Procedural History**
	* π's complaint didn't allege ∂'s state of incorporation or principal place of business, and so didn't establish diversity jurisdiction.

* **Reasoning**
	* A registered office isn't the same thing as a principal place of business
	* Corporations have dual-citizenship: where they're incorporated and in their principal place of business. Both need to be distinct from the other party's in order to establish diversity jurisdiction.

* **Notes**
	* Dismissing a case "with prejudice" means that π can't file another suit on the same claim.

#### Hertz Corporation v. Friend
* SCOTUS 2010, Breyer

* **Parties**
	* π: Hertz Corporation
	* ∂: Friend - (& Nheiu--two Hertz employees)

* **Facts**
	* Friend is a CA citizen. 
	* Hz does a lot of business in CA, but also a lot in many other states.
	* Hz is headquartered in NJ & handles some other corporate responsibilities in OK. 
	* CA dist. ct. accepted these facts.

* **Procedural History**
	* Friend sued Hertz for violation of wage & hour laws & wanted to bring a class action suit with other CAns
	* Friend did *not* want diversity since he wanted to sue in CA ct. 
	* Hz wanted to remove the case to federal ct., so Hz wants to argue its PPB isn't in CA
	* CA dist. ct. said Hz was a CA citizen said Hz's business predominated in CA since it was next in line after NJ & OK.
	* 9th circuit affirmed
	* SCOTUS granted cert since circuits have gone different ways here 

* **Issue**
	* Is a corp's PPB where it is HQ'd?

* **Reasoning**
	* Since Friend is CAn, if Hertz's principal place of business is CA, then there can't be diversity jurisdiction
	* **III**
		* diversity jurisdiction isn't automatic based on art III §2--just authorizes Congress to give diversity jurisdiction.
		* Incorporation was originally deemed equivalent to domicile since shareholders were presumed to be citizens of the incorporating state.
		* A committee of judges suggested PPB doctrine to Congress in 1957 & written into law in 1958
	* **IV**
		* The law didn't establish criteria for determining PPB
		* Lots of standards developed as a result & different circuits were inconsistent
		* This is bad for admin. simplicity.
	* **V**
		* **A**
			* PPB should be the "nerve center" which is usually where the corp is HQd
			* Three reasons for this:
				1. Most natural way to read the statute (28 USC § 1332(c)(1))
					* If PPB is about where a corp does the most business, CA will often win by volume just due to its size. That seems weird.
				2. Administrative simplicity. Simple standards mean simple, efficient decisions. Predictability goes in here, too.
				3. Legislative history.
		* **B**
			* "Nerve center" test isn't perfect, but it's better than any other standard we've tried & simplicity of application outweighs the downsides.
			* Burden for establishing diversity is on whoever is asserting it.
		
* **Holding**
	* Vacated 9th circuit's decision.

* **Rule**
	* A corporation's principal place of business is wherever its never center is.
 
#### Non-incorporated businesses
* 28 USC § 1332 (c)(1) doesn't apply to non-incorporated businesses (e.g. partnernships, associations)
* Partnerships are citizens of the states where each of its members are citizens.
* If a partnership had a member in every state, it could never be sued under diversity jurisdiction.
* Congress hasn't said anything about the citizenship of LLCs.

#### Belleville Catering Co. v. Champaign Market Place LLC
* 7th Cir 2003, Easterborook

* **Parties**
	* π: Belleville Catering Co.
	* ∂: Champaign Market Place LLC

* **Facts**

* **Procedural History**
	* π said they're MO-based & ∂ is a DE corp with its PPB in IL and so there should be diversity jurisdiction
	* ∂ agreed & filed a counter-claim
	* Ct took jurisdiction allegations at face-value
	* Trial jury gave ∂ $220k in their counter-claim.
	* πs appealed
	* Jurisdiction in appeal was the same.

* **Reasoning**
	* LLCs are the same as partnerships for citizenship purposes--they are a citizen of every state of which their members are citizens.

* **Rule**
	* LLCs are the same as partnerships for citizenship purposes--they are a citizen of every state of which their members are citizens.
 
#### Representative suits & assignments of claims
* Tort claims usually aren't assignable, but contract claims usually are.
* Sometimes a π will try assign her claim to a representative who is a citizen of a different state as the ∂ in order to get diversity jurisdiction.
* 28 USC § 1359 precludes fed jurisdiction when one party assigned the claim *collusively* in order to invoke jurisdiction
* The assignment still stands, but the diversity doesn't
* Since 28 USC § 1359 requires collusion (which requires at least two people), one party can change citizenship in order to get diversity.

#### Domestic relations & probate exceptions
* Fed cts won't hear "domestic relations" cases (divorce, separation, etc.)
* This doesn't apply to non-domestic issues in which the parties are family members.
* Fed cts also will not hear probate cases

#### Amount in controversy requirement
* Fed cts won't hear cases where the controversy involves <$75k

#### Federal Question Jurisdiction
* Various statutes grant federal courts jurisdiction under specific areas of federal law, such as antitrust (§ 1337), patent & trademark (§ 1338), and civil rights (§ 1343)
* Rationale
	* Federal courts are in the best position to protect federal interests
	* Federal courts can specialize & develop expertise

#### Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co. v. Mottley 
* 1908, Moody

* **Parties**
	* π: Louisville & Nashville RR
	* ∂: Mottley

* **Facts**
	* As compensation for an earlier claim, π gave ∂ lifetime passes.
	* π honored the pass until the fed gov't said RRs couldn't give out passes like that.
	* No diversity of citizenship.

* **Procedural History**
	* ∂ sued when π stopped honoring passes.

* **Issue**
	* Did Circuit Ct. have jurisdiction?

* **Reasoning**
	* THe π in a suit can't assert an imagined possible constitutional defense from the ∂ in order to claim a constitutional dispute for jurisdictional purposes.
 
* **Notes**
	* "Well-pleaded complaint" rule - complaint only contains the π's complaint, without any anticipatory allegations of responses from the ∂

#### Grable & Sons Metal Products Inc. v. Darue Engineering
* SCOTUS 2005, Souter

* **Parties**
	* π: Grable & Sons
	* ∂: Darue Engineering & Manufacturing

* **Facts**
	* IRS seized π's property to settle delinquent taxes
	* Gov't sold the property to ∂.

* **Procedural History**
	* Five years(!) later, π sued saying they hadn't been properly notified under § 6335(a): written notice must be given to secretary or owner of a business or left at owner's home or business.
	* π said svc required personal service--not certified mail
	* ∂ removed to fed ct. since the claim was based on fed. tax law.
	* π wanted to remand back to state ct.
	* Dist. ct. kept the case: Even though π did't have a fed. cause of action, the question was one of fed. interest.
	* Dist. ct. gave summary judgment to ∂ saying gov't had complied sufficiently with § 6335(a)
	* 6th circuit ct. of app. affirmed. Title claim was an issue of fed. law that needed to be decided & fed gov't has an interest in settling tax law ?s.

* **Issue**
	* Can federal courts claim jurisdiction when a state dispute turns on a matter of federal law?

* **Reasoning**
	* **II**
		* "Arising under" jurisdiction - fed. ct. can adjudicate cases where federal question jurisdiction trumps state law disputes -- state claims that turn on questions of federal law.
			* Fed ct. has experience
			* Promotes consistency
			* Only applies when there is a substantive ? of federal law
			* Can still be vetoed
			* Since any such case can create federalism controversies, the reasons for asserting jurisdiction always have to be considered.
	* **III**
		* **A**
			* π's claim has to provide the facts that establish the superiority of the state question.
			* The (federal) notice question is superior here since it turns on the meaning  & interpretation of § 6335(a)
			* The gov't has a strong interest in adjudicating tax & notice questions.
			* This case is comparatively small, so the potential for stepping on states' rights is pretty small.
		* **B**
			* *Merrell Dow* disclaimed bright-line rules for state v. fed. jurisd. ?s.
			* 

* **Holding**
	* 

* **Rule**
	* 
 
* **Concurrence**
	* Thomas.
	* Shouldn't limit federal jurisdiction just to cases where the cause of action itself arises under fed. law.

* **Notes**

#### Supplemental jurisdiction
* If π has two claims, one state & one federal against ∂, and there's no other basis for claiming fed. jurisdiction regarding the state claim, fed ct.s *can* claim jurisdiction as long as the claims are closely related. "pendent" or "ancillary" justification.

#### Removal jurisdiction
* ∂ can ask to "remove" a case from state to federal court.
* ∂ may want the case to be heard by unelected judges, or fear bias in the state court
* ∂ doesn't need fed. ct's permission to remove. She just does it & the ct can then remand if it thinks the removal is improper.
* Can only remove to the local dist. ct.
* ∂ has 3o days after svc of process to remove

## Venue
* Ct. can't hear a case unless it has (1) personal and (2) subject matter jurisdiction
* Subject matter is what categories of cases a court *system* can hear
* Personal jurisdiction is whether a court system has authority over a ∂
* Third req'ment is *venue* -- where *inside* a system a case can be heard
* def'd largely by statute
* No const'l right to a particular venue
* Ct can transfer to another venue if it thinks another may be more appropriate

### Local & Transitory actions
* Local: cases involving land that have to be heard where that land is
	* in rem or q-i-r cases where real property is basis for jurisdiction
	* realty cases (e.g. quiet title, foreclosure, liens, etc.)
	* cases of damage to land, e.g. trespass
* Transitory: everything else

### Venue in Fed Ct.
* A fed. ct. would only have PJ over someone if the state that ct. is in would have PJ.
* PJ & venue statutes can overlap
* 94 fed. dists.
* Dists. can be divided into "divisions"
* Most fed. venue is governed by USC 28 § 1391
	* local & transitory don't count for fed. venue
	* suit can be brought 
		* in the dist. where any ∂ lives **OR**
		* in the dist where the controversy happened **OR**
		* anywhere that has PJ if neither of the other criteria work
	* Corps. can be sued in any district where it could have PJ if it were a state
		* **OR** the state with the most significant contacts if no dist. would have PJ
	* Foreign national can be sued in any dist.
	
#### Bates v. C & S Adjusters, Inc.
* 2d cir 1992

* **Parties**
	* π: Bates
	* ∂: C & S Adjusters

* **Facts**
	* π incurred debt while living in PA
	* π moved to NY
	* ∂ mailed collection notice to π at his PA address that the post office forwarded to his address in NY

* **Procedural History**
	* π sued in NY for violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act & asked for damages & costs
	* case was dismissed due to improper venue
	* ∂ appealed & filed a counterclaim 

* **Issue**
	* Does venue exist where ∂ resides & where notice is sent?

* **Reasoning**
	* USC 28 § 1391(b)(2) allows suit where a "substantial part of the events or omission" in the controversy occurred.
	* courts apply a "weight of contacts" test
	* *Leroy* tried to prevent recognizing multiple venues, but § 1391(b)(2) evolved to expand the number of potential venues
	* Other courts have recognized that mailing a collection notice to a debtor's address is sufficient.
	* It doesn't matter that the letter went to PA before reaching π in NY.
	* The letter ended up in NY (substantial part of events) & ∂ didn't object to PJ there, so venue was proper.

* **Holding**
	* Reversed & remanded. Venue was proper
 
### Change of Venue
#### Transfer in state cts.
* All states allow intra-state venue transfers
* "forum non conveniens" - court dismisses a case because it would be more appropriately decided in another venue

#### Transfer in fed. cts.
* Fed cts can transfer from one dist. to another. Dists. don't need to be in the same state.
* § 1404, transferor is a proper venue; § 1406, transferor is an improper venue
* Can transfer anywhere suit may have been brought: *venue & PJ are satisfied* or where all parties have consented
* *Goldlawr* - 1406 transferor (improper venue) cts. *don't* need PJ
* Contracts may have forum selection clauses
#### Choice of law
* CoL rules vary from state to state
* In state cases, the state where the case is heard will apply its laws
* In fed cases, if there is no relevant fed. law, ct will apply state law
* The state's law that's used is the state in which the ct. sits.
* When a case is transferred, the law applied is that of the state in which the *transferor* sits

#### Multidistrict litigation
* Mass torts, where there are claims in many districts, can be consolidated for *pretrial proceedings*
* Other venue requirements don't apply
* After pretrial,  §1407 says cases "shall be remanded" to their original venues
* Often though, the court that hears the pretrial proceedings will 1406 or 1407 the case to itself for trial. SCOTUS rejected this practice, but it's allowed when both parties consent
