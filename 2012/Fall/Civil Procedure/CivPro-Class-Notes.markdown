# Civil Procedure Class Notes

## August 27
### Introductions
* Mark Weisburd, Rm 5118, 919.962.8515, amw@email.unc.edu
* Civil procedure - Everything that happens in a civil lawsuit *outside* the courtroom.
* A rule must be neither too broad nor too narrow.

### Personal Jurisdiction
* People assume they are not beholden to governments to which they have no connection.
* Look at p. 138 in the rulebook. Federal form 3, summons.
* Many states (incl. NC) have adopted the Federal rules.
* Form book has forms describing the structure of various types of legal documents.
* Writ of execution - Order to the sherif from the judge to execute a judgment. E.g. seizing property, auctioning it off, giving the proceeds from the sale to the plaintiff in the amount of the judgment, and returning to the defendant anything in excess of that judgment.
* Summons - Assertion of authority by the government. The gov't presents a complaint that must be answered within some number of days before a judgment of default.
* Government exercises authority in settling disputes between private citizens. A citizen initiates the process, but then it becomes a government power.
* 53 US court systems, including federal court systems, and one for each state & territory (Guam & PR)
* A case from the state courts will only be heard in a federal court only if that case goes to SCOTUS which it will only if it involves a matter of federal law. Otherwise state supreme court has supreme authority.
* pg. 9, Full faith & credit
* Say a judgment is made in NC against a resident of TN without any property in NC. Full faith & credit requires that a TN sheriff execute that judgment.
* pg 213, title 28 sec 1738 3rd para. FF&C
* Title 28 is the judiciary code.
* Warrantee deed - Seller claims good title & pledges to defend that title in court
* Quick claim deed - Seller makes no claim of good title on the property

## August 28
### Personal Jurisdiction (cont'd)
* Pennoyer didn't have good title because Mitchell didn't have good title because the Sherriff didn't have good title because the initial judgment was invalid.
* Full faith & credit only applies where there is jurisdiction. (cf. Field p. 26)
* **Subject matter jurisdiction** - what kinds of suits a court may hear
* n1, pg 29.: The lawsuit is about a specific piece of property & who will own it at the end of the proceeding. In rem.
* In personam - No particular item will be covered in the judgment--rather a particular person will be affected by the judgment.
* In an in personal case, any property may be executed in a judgment.
* An in rem case regarding property in NC may only be heard in NC.
* An in personam case involving NC residents may be heard in any court that has personal jurisdiction over the participants.
* Service of process:
	* informs the defendant what the lawsuit says
	* formally brings the defendant under the power of the court
* Without serving process, the court doesn't really "have its hooks" in the defendant
* In order to have in rem jurisdiction on some property, a court in the state in which the property is located has to attach the property
* Different types of In Rem:
	* Pure in rem: The government says something about a piece of property that is true for anybody in the world (Condemning a building).
	* Quasi-in-rem type 1: Binds only the people given notice in the suit. If there's a 3rd party not involved in the suit who wants to make a claim on that property, this does not cover that party.
	* Quasi-in-rem type 2: Not about the property at all. The property is treated only as a fund to serve as payment in another judgment.
* The state may address the legal status of any resident of that state
	* A marriage is a thing (res) so a divorce is essentially an in rem case, and so may be decided in the state where either spouse lives.
* Suits in which the defendant is domiciled in a particular state (domicile vs. residence--domicile is stronger than residence--it's where you think of as home)
* A domiciliary is always subject to the courts of the domicile.
* Neff was not domiciled in OR when service of process by publication was conducted in OR therefore the service was void
* Even if Neff had known about the suit (if service had been published in CA) service would still have been invalid
* 14th amendment was not part of the constitution when the OR state court heard it (so why did Field cite it in his opinion)
* 14th amdmt supersedes state law
* The relevant rule was 28 U.S.C., ยง 1738. Though that didn't apply since OR didn't have personal jurisdiction over Neff
* At the time of Pennoyer, "common law" was what judges reasoned it to be. There was a presumption that there would be only one thing for reason to demand in a given case.
* Field is taking as law what he derives through reason from first principles, where those first principles are stated laws.

## August 29
### Personal Jurisdiction (cont'd)
* Takeaways from Pennoyer
	* If someone in one state wants to sue someone in that state who does not reside there, he must serve process in that state. Connection b/w in personam jurisdiction and the territory
	* Full faith & credit does not apply when process is not served in the state where the suit is originated
 * Standard for personal jurisdiction and the standard for whether full faith & credit must be given should be the same.
* Most states that have answered the question have said that if a defendant was forcibly brought into jurisdiction in order to serve process there, then that process is valid.
* This is not the case if the defendant was tricked.
* It's important to remember the facts of a case in addition to the holding. The holding depends on the factual context in which the case was decided.
* A later court can re-characterize the reasoning of an earlier ruling
* To be able to impose a condition such that "if we permit you to do X, you must do Y" the state must be able to forbid doing X.
* Privileges & immunities: Article IV ยง2 & 14th Amendment ยง1

#### After Pennoyer
* A corporation is distinct from anyone involved in that corporation
* Asserting personal distinction over a corporation...
* Once states started recognizing corporations incorporated in other states...
* Corporations may do business in states other than where they were incorporated
* "Foreign" corporations mean from another state
* Since states may forbid foreign corporations from doing business inside them, they can also impose conditions on them.
* SCOTUS said that states cannot keep corporations from doing interstate commerce in their borders.
* If the corporation is "doing business" in the state, it is present in the state
* A NC-ian in a traffic accident in Siberia can be sued for that accident in Siberia

## August 30
### Personal Jurisdiction (cont'd)
* How fast is the potential defendant moving through the state?
* Automobile travel increased the possibility & likelihood of interstate travel.
* How do legal realities change when a non-resident can move through a jurisdiction at speed, if you have to serve process when that person is in the jurisdiction?

#### Hess v. Pawloski
* Some terminological notes:
	* Writ of error. Someone thinks the lower court made a mistake & files a writ of error. As Pawloski.
	* In MA, the name of the state legislature is the "General Court"
	* Highest court is the "Supreme Judicial Court"
* Pennoyer is about the location of the defendant when process is served
* MA wants to regulate the underlying activity -- the use of roads wherever the user happens to reside
* MA invents consent to jurisdiction in order to satisfy the standard of Pennoyer.
* MA is within its rights to deny people the right to drive on its roads without an MA license, which allows it to impose conditions for allowing the same, such as that about appointing the registrar as an agent.
* In Pennoyer, the Court thought it was in familiar territory (i.e. a contract dispute) and the rules about asserting jurisdiction over nonresidents.
* In Hess, the activity appears novel, as evidenced by the court's description of the dangers of motor vehicles (p.35)

## September 4
* Bases for personal jurisdiction circa *Pennoyer* - 
	* Domicile
	* Personal jurisdiction can only be asserted over domiciliaries of that jurisdiction
	* Consent - Opting into jurisdiction.
	* Waiver - Opting not to defend against claim of jurisdiction
	* Service of process while the defendant is inside the territory controlled by that jurisdiction
* That the plaintiff sought the intervention of the court is sufficient to establish jurisdiction over that plaintiff
* Challenges to *Pennoyer* understanding of personal jurisdiction:
	* Technological advances in transportation - people can move more quickly and so can leave territories before service of process
	* Service of process depending on presence in a state doesn't do much good when the defendant doesn't have a physical presence (e.g. corporations)
	* Limits on states power - if the states cannot exclude corporations from their borders, there's no basis for asserting jurisdiction based on implied consent due to their presence.
* "doing business" was a standard that arose out of these challenges.
* "doing business" had to meet a threshold of activity before jurisdiction kicked in.
* *Pennoyer* turned on where the defendant was when process was served.
* In *Hess*, the focus wasn't on where the defendant was when process was served--it was on the activity he was performing & where he performed it.

#### International Shoe
* "doing business" used to colloquially mean presence before it became a term of art.
* J. Stone: "presence" isn't a useful thing to state in arguing one way or the other whether WA may assert jurisdiction--whether ISC's activity in WA constitutes "presence" precisely *is* the question.
* Minimum contact with a state is sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction
* In *Pennoyer*, the transaction is irrelevant. We just care about the location of service.
* In ISC, the contacts support personal jurisdiction because the contacts relate to the content of the suit.
* Shepard's citations tell you what cases cite a particular case.
* Statute of limitations doesn't begin to run for corporations until they meet qualifications to do business.
* Fairness in ISC means the extent to which it's fair to see a party having a connection with a state in respect of its contacts with that state.
* International Shoe's criteria for personal jurisdiction: 
	* Quality & nature of the contact with the state, and 
	* the relationship between those contacts and the case.
* Courts view equation of tax jurisdiction with personal jurisdiction as an exercise of state power.
	
##### Black's dissent
* Hugo Black was a great supporter of the New Deal
* *Freedom of contract* - doctrine that forbade government interference in contractual agreements between two parties
* Black was a strict constructionist.

#### McGee v. International Life
* Full faith & credit case.
* McGee won a judgment in CA and wanted the TX courts to give it full faith & credit
* Just because the state asserts an interest doesn't mean that the interest is sufficient to assert jurisdiction.
* In *McGee*, CA's interest was related to the connection at issue.

#### Hanson v. Denckla
* *Trust* - Transfer of property from on party to another (the trustee), where the trustee must administer the property in the interests of a third party. The third party has no control over the property, but received profits from it.
* Beneficiary of a trust has recourse in a court of equity.
* Donner trust didn't specify who would be the beneficiary after she died.
* Her will did not explicitly address the trust.
* She created a power of appointment that named beneficiaries of the trust.
* Parallel suits in DE in FL. (FL was the wicked aunts, and DE was the mother of the two nephews)
* FL court made a judgment for the aunts.
* SCOTUS case was about whether DE needed to give full faith & credit to the FL decision.

#### Gray v. American Radiator & Stanford Sanitary Corp.
* "long arm" statutes: states "reach out" to defendants that aren't in that state.
* Why would Titan assume that American Radiator wanted its valves? Fair to say that Titan knew its valves would end up in water heaters that it would then sell to people who wanted them.
* Titan not only knew this would happen, but their business depends on American Radiator's ability to sell water heaters. End user was going to be a consumer who needed a water heater.
* Ultimate customers of valves are the IL purchasers of water heaters.
* Titan thus benefits from protection IL laws.

#### World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson
* In OK, if a trial ct does something outside of its discretion, one can appeal to the OK Supreme Court for a "writ of mandate"
* Defendant in such a proceeding is the trial judge (here, Woodson)
* Audi & VW of America didn't contest personal jurisdiction.
* Subject matter jurisdiction of federal courts depends on the citizenship of the litigants. No plaintiff can be a citizen of the same state as any of the defendants.
* Robinsons were technically still domiciled in NY (where Seaway & WWVW were incorporated).
* A suit brought in a state ct that could have been brought in fed ct may be removed to the federal ct.
* If VW & Audi could get WWVW & Seaway out of the suit, they could thus get the case removed to federal court (OK was friendly to plaintiffs).
* Hence VW & Audi paying to attack personal jurisdiction over WWVW & Seaway.
* "Foreseeable" - not an extraordinary occurrence
* The marginal revenue WWVW got from the car due its use in OK was very small and thus not sufficient for minimum contact - Marginal revenue here would be the difference in cost between a car that could not go to OK and one that could.
* WWVW wasn't setting out to sell cars in OK. OK wasn't a factor in WWVW's operations.
* *WWVW* was a reaffirmation of the rule in *Hanson*
* Rephrase of White's principle, rather than saying whether a party could anticipate being sued somewhere, might be more apt to put it in terms of a party's knowing whether they were going to establish a connection with w forum by their presence there and activities conducted.

## September 11
* The basic idea of personal jurisdiction is that it is an individual's right that a sovereign ought not to be able to control an individual.

### Federal Jurisdiction
* Personal jurisdiction of a federal trial court in a state is no greater than that of the containing state
* General jurisdiction: subject matter jurisdiction over any kind of suit that is not prohibited through a statute
* Fed jurisdiction is subject to the same minimum contact reqs as states.
* Fed cts are bound by the state laws regarding jurisdiction in that state.
* Fed rule 4(k) covers the rules for federal jurisdiction
* A few fed statutes permitting nationwide service of process 4(k)(C)
* 4(k)(2): D has no minimum contact with a particular state but does with the US as a whole, such as when a state has narrow personal jurisdiction statutes, and that is the only state a D has contact with (*Graduate Management Admissions Council v. Raju*).

### *Keeton v. Hustler Magazine Inc.*
* Equal protection says that if you have the right to sue in one state you have the right to sue in any state.

### *Keeton v. Calder*
* Shirley Jones sued the National Enquirer
* Only way to interpret P's actions was that they intended to defame D in CA.

### Why litigants care about where litigation occurs
* Back in *Pennoyer*, it mattered a great deal, since travel was so limited.
* For a breach of contract suit regarding a contract drawn in NC, any court would apply NC contract law in adjudicating the dispute.

### *Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz*
* BK wanted to sue MI franchises in FL (where BK HQ was located)
* MI, by becoming franchisees, had a contractual relationship to a FL entity & so had minimum contact.
* There could be a suit that was so inconvenient to litigate in a particular venue that it would violate due process.

## September 12
### Asahi Metal Industry Co. Ltd v. Superior Court of California, Solano County (Cheng Shin Rubber Industrial Co, Ltd, Real Party in Interest)
* Cross-complaint (in Fed Ct., impleader) - trial procedure wherein a party against who a claim is made alleges that if he is liable on that claim, then there is a third party liable for some or all of any judgment
* Indemnification - a kind of remedy that can be sought in impleader where the third party pays the totality of the judgment.
* Any indemnification right Asahi has against Cheng Shin is through contract.
* "Choice of law" clause in a contract specifies which laws will apply should a dispute arise.
* CA: "Interest analysis" choose the law that benefits the CA resident in a dispute. If neither party is a CA resident, choose the CA law since the judge will be most familiar with it.
* Scalia dissented here because he doesn't like balancing tests.
* O'Connor's reasoning essentially means you can *never* reach a component manufacturer.
* Starting with the language of WWVW, you should end up at the opposite result from where O'Connor got.
* O'Connor: Two-prongs
	* Contacts
	* Litigation fairness
* Brennan agrees with first & disagrees with the second.
* Asahi introduces a balancing test, so you have to consider the interests of both parties & the forum state.
* When you introduce litigation fairness as a factor, then every personal jurisdiction question has to be looked at on a case-by-case basis.
* Stevens's question of whether contacts were necessary is crucial. S thinks just going against "fair play and substantial justice" is enough to deny jurisdiction.

## September 13
### J. McIntyre Machinery vs. Nicastro
* Kennedy wants more than foreseeability. Must be efforts directed towards a particular market.
* Purpose to deal with everywhere is not a purpose to deal with anywhere specifically
* K, like O'Connor in *Asahi*, doesn't adequately specify *why* stream-of-commerce is insufficient.

## September 17
### Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown
* In *Helicopteros*, SCOTUS established that purchases by themselves are never sufficient for personal jurisdiction.

## September 18
* Explicit content vs. implied (deemed) consent
* Contracts may include provisions for forum selection and choice-of-law
* When you opt into a forum, you consent to jurisdiction for counter-claims in that forum.
* A company that goes into arbitration multiple times has an advantage in that process (1) in arbitration expertise and (2) possibly due to bias toward that company (i.e. the repeat customer).

### Shaffer v. Heitner
* Money recovered under a shareholder derivative suit goes into the corporate treasury--not to ฯ. 
* If we take general jurisdiction based on domicile for granted, why would we give any weight to property ownership?
* Contacts always matter. Even in *in rem* cases. They'll be easy to establish in suits over the property itself or arising in duties the owners of property have to other people.
* In *Shaffer* we have to think about what counts as a high-quality contact.
* Subject matter jurisdiction is only available in a live controversy.
* NC courts can't give advisory opinions.
* Being an officer of a DE corp isn't sufficient as a contact for jurisdiction.
* Chartering a corp is one of the things that can have an extraterritorial effect
* This was a suit against individuals--not a corp
* Brennan's opinion
	* What if you used the same argument for local property? The state has strong interest in adjudicating disputes concerning local property.
* **The presence of property alone isn't enough to establish jurisdiction for a suit unrelated to the property.**
* *Shaffer* hasn't been used in cases where property is attached just to immobilize the property rather than to assert PJ

### Transient presence
* SCOTUS had said that letting his kids move to a state doesn't give that state PJ, but in *Burnham v. Superior Court of California* overruled this.

### PJ on the web & internationally
* The web has a big impact on personal jurisdiction. Anybody with a website can be in contact with everyplace else, and everyone with a website knows that.
* Y! was sued in France for facilitating the sale of Nazi memorabilia. 
* Dow Jones was sued for defamation in Australia by an Australian
* When you think about PJ in another country, it may not be either as expansive or as limited as American PJ.
* Some countries will allow any property in its borders to be sufficient to establish PJ over the owner of that property.
* Purposeful availment isn't relevant in European law. PJ in *WWVW* would have been valid in EU.

### Revell v. Lidov
* A passive website is not sufficient to establish PJ
* *Zippo* test isn't particularly useful anymore since there aren't really passive websites anymore.
* Court mentions that it needs to evaluate interactivity and then doesn't do that evaluation
* Once you get onto the web, you lose the sales/circulation component of the *Calder* argument.
* The passivity (or not) of a website wouldn't really effect the harm of an article published on it. In *Calder*, if Shirley Jones could've emailed natl-enquirer.com or commented there, the harm would still have been done.
* *Calder* inquiry & interactivity inquiry are the stage for the reasoning in *Revell*.
* In some cases, the location of the harm caused is irrelevant (*contra Calder*). If someone in MI says a Dr kills all of his patients

## September 24
### Statutes of Personal Jurisdiction
* States must write laws describing the circumstances under which they can assert PJ
* CA's & RI's PJ laws say they can assert PJ whenever they are permitted to do so by the US Constitution. But that means that every PJ case in those states is a constitutional question.
* States with narrower PJ laws (bright-line rules) gain efficiency by not having to litigate the constitutional issues
* Elected state judges have an incentive to try to allow lawsuits to proceed which results in weird case law about PJ
* Under the facts of *Gray v. American Radiator*, IL interpreted "a tortious act or omission in [IL]" to mean that since the damage occurred in IL, that's where the tort was. A NY ct using the same language decided that there was no act or omission in the NY, so there was no tort there.
* GA PJ law explicitly provides for the case where an act outside of the state causes a tort inside the state.
* Not always easy to tell from a statute what the legislature intended the statute to do.
* Cts can either try to guess at the intent of a statute or read it literally & leave it up to the legislature to amend the statute if the result is other than what the legislature intended.
* Pitfall in statutory interpretation is isolating the statute from its context
* If one provision would make another provision either surplus or conflicting, it is wrong. 
* Statutes have to be read as a whole.
* In statutory interpretation, the specific always controls the general.
* If there is more than one reasonable interpretation of the statute, and one interpretation would raise a constitutional issue at either the state or federal level, the interpretation without any issues is preferred.

## Notice
* Notice problems don't turn on the content of the notice.
* Notice includes a summons and a complaint.
* If there's a problem with the summons or complaint, it's not a notice problem.
* Federal form 3 is a summons--almost idiot proof
* Notice questions turn on what efforts are made & required to be made to get the summons in front of โ.
* "Actual notice" isn't sufficient if it doesn't meet constitutional requirements for adequate notice under due process.
* "Actual notice" just means that โ knew of the proceeding

### Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co.
* An effort by NY to allow financial institutions to make some money by consolidating trusts into funds.
* J. Jackson was a political ally of FDR's & was his SG.
* HST asked him to prosecute at Nuremburg.
* Trustee had to present its accounts to the court & if any of the beneficiaries had an issue with the way the trustee was going to distribute its funds, the proceeding in question was the last chance to do so.
* Jurisdiction needed to be over the beneficiaries.
* Not an in rem claim about the money in the fund, but rather an PJ issue of the rights of the beneficiaries.
* 50% chance of winning $100k would be valued at $50k. After the judge rules, the chance is worth nothing. ฯs stand to lose property.
* The reason we care about PJ over ฯs here is that they stand to lose property.
* Whenever you have the potential of taking someone's property, due process must be fulfilled.
* Means employed to serve notice must be such as you would use if you actually wanted to notify someone
* "Best notice practicable under the circumstances"
* Test isn't whether party was notified, rather it's whether the proper amount & type of effort was used in attempting to give notice
* "Notice" is a notion of abstract justice.
* Problem with Jackson's reasoning:
	* It doesn't matter whether everyone gets notice, since as long as most do, the interests of all of them will be protected
	* This isn't necessarily true.
	* Mullane represents the beneficiaries, but among the recipients there can be two groups. Some may not care if the fund isn't maximizing revenue as long as they're minimizing risk. Others may want more profit even if it means more risk.

## September 25
* There's a universe of people over which cts can assert jurisdiction, and notice is how the state narrows it down to the people over whom it actually asserts jurisdiction
* Post-*Mullane*, notice requirements have grown very strict. Notice has to account for the real-world circumstances.

### Statutory requirements
* If courts want bright-line rules about who is subject to PJ, they especially want bright-line rules about when notice is sufficient.
* With a straightforward rule, there's less need to litigate
* But if there's a bright-line rule, you have to follow it.
* Notice has to meet the *Mullane* standard as well as any local statutory requirements

#### National Dev. Co. v. Triad Holding Co.
* Actual notice isn't sufficient if there was a failure to follow the rules of notice
* Ct: Could it be said that K had some kind of permanent connection to NY apt?
* Yes. He spent stupid amounts of money on remodeling.
* "dwelling place" probably means "place with which a party has a permanent connection"
* K's situation is one that the statute did not anticipate

## September 26
## F.R.C.P. Rule 4
* Rule 4(d) is about waiving service of process. ฯ can request that โ waive service of process.
* Rule 4(e) covers the positive process of serving process. 4(e)(1) is just about the states, and 4(e)(2) gets into Federal procedure.
* Service of process statutes are distinct from long-arm statutes.
* 4(f) is service in a foreign country.
* 4(h) is service of a corporation. Refers back to 4(e)(1) allowing service of process according to state law. The other way to do it is to serve process to an officer of the corporation
	* "officer" is a term of art. 
* Standard for who can be served in a corporation: 
	* Do the duties of the position require the person in that position to routinely handle important documents?
* 4(k)(1)(B) applies only in a very narrow set of circumstances.
* 4(l) requires proof of service, though failure to prove service doesn't affect the validity of service.
* 4(m) is a recent addition. Before it was added, there wasn't any time limit after a claim was filed for serving process.
* In most cases, as long as claims are filed w/in the statute of limitations, process may be served after. Though some states require both the claim to be filed and process to be served within the statute of limitations.

### Right to a hearing
* It's rare for the government to act against a person without giving that person a hearing, but it does happen.
	* Temporary restraining order (TRO) - no more than 10 days - prevent person from irreparably damaging another person or property
		* It's necessary to attempt to notify person against whom restraining order has been asked, but a court can apply the TRO *ex parte*
		* Next step is a preliminary injunction.
		* If the damage is something that could be fixed with money, it's not irreparable, and so TRO isn't an option.
		* Person requesting a TRO may have to pay a bond in case the other party incurs damage due to the delay.
	* Seizures of property 
		* Repossession.
		* SCOTUS upheld seizure of property without notice when:
			* party attempting seizure had interest in the property and that interest was demonstrable through incontrovertible (paper) record
			* party has to post a bond to protect against damage
			* party property is taken from has to be able to get a hearing ASAP after the seizure without any kind of bond in order to explain their rights to the property

### Subject matter jurisdiction
* In other legal systems, called "competence"
* Categories of cases a court is allowed to hear
* Contrasted to PJ, which is about which people can appear before the court
* General subject matter jurisdiction v. limited subject matter jurisdiction
* In subj. matter court, first thing you have to do is prove jurisdiction
* **NC --> dist.ct --> superior ct. --> ct. of app. --> supreme ct.**
* NC: Family matters go straight from dist. ct. to ct. of app.
