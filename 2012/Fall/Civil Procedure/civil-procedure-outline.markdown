# Civil Procedure Outline
## Jurisdiction
### Jurisdiction over the parties
#### Personal Jurisdiction
* A state may assert personal jurisdiction over µ if:
	1. There is a state statute that allows courts to claim PJ **AND**
	2. µ is an individual **AND**
		* µ is present in the state and served process while in the state
		* **OR** µ is a domiciliary of the state
		* **OR** µ consents to jurisdiction
			* Consent may be implied through actions, such as use of roads (*Hess v. Pawloski*)
			* Bringing suit in a forum suffices for consent to jurisdiction in that forum
	3. µ is a corporation **AND**
		* µ is incorporated in the state
		* **OR** µ has minimum contacts with the state (*International Shoe*)
			* Minimum contacts require:
				1. Contacts
					* Are contacts casual or systematic & continuous?
					* Is the suit related to those contacts?
						* Are µ's activities directed towards the market in the forum state? (*Nicastro*)
						* By virtue of those contacts has µ *purposely availed* itself of the benefits of the forum state's laws? (*Hanson*)
						* Is the contact the basis for the suit? (reinsurance contract in *McGee*)
						* Location of harm caused (*Calder*)
				2. Fairness - "traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice" (*International Shoe*)
					* 5 factors of fairness (*WWVW*)
						1. Burden on the defendant to litigate in the state
						2. Interests of the forum state in adjudicating (*McGee*)
						3. π's interest in convenient & effective relief
						4. The efficiency of the judicial system as a whole
						5. The interest of all of the states in promoting social policies
* A federal court may assert personal jurisdiction if:
	* The district, if it were a state, would be able to assert personal jurisdiction

#### In rem jurisdiction
* Quasi-in-rem jurisdiction
	* Only available if the property is attached at the start of the case **AND** proper notice is given (*Pennoyer*)
