* [8/30/2012][8-30-2012]

## 8/27/2012[8-27-2012]

	* Audience - Who am I writing for?
	* Tone - What is the voice?

* Primary authority - literally "the law"
	* Created by legislators
* Secondary authority - persuasive at best
	* Restatements, law reviews, etc.
* Mandatory authority must be followed
	* Statutes from controlling jurisdictions
