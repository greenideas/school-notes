# RRWA Class Notes
* [8/27/2012][8-27-2012]
* [8/30/2012][8-30-2012]

## 8/27/2012[8-27-2012]
* Rhetorical Triangle:
	* Audience - Who am I writing for?
	* Tone - What is the voice?
	* Purpose - What am I trying to achieve?
* "Managing upward" - Anticipate the needs of the decision maker and incorporate that into documents you produce for them.

## 8/30/2012[8-30-2012]
* Omit surplus words - Avoid compound constructions and "throat-clearing" phrases
* Sources of law:
	* Constitutions - Founders/Framers
	* Statutes - Legislators
	* Regulations - Government agencies
	* Case law/Common law - judges, Article III of the Constitution (for federal law)
* Common law - The accumulated precedent of many judicial decisions
* Case law - Interpretation of existing laws/statutes - Are statutes correctly applied? Constitutional?
* Primary authority - literally "the law"
	* Created by legislators
* Secondary authority - persuasive at best
	* Restatements, law reviews, etc.
* Mandatory authority must be followed
	* Statutes from controlling jurisdictions
* Persuasive authority - provides guidelines for future decisions
	* Statutes, common law from non-controlling jurisdiction
* Judicial hierarchies
	* US District ct > US Ct. of app > SCOTUS
	* Local trial ct > Intermediate app. ct. > Highest state ct
* District cts organized into circuits
* Fed ct has 12 circuits
* Legal encyclopedias - summaries of legal topics
	* Gen legal encyc - CJS, Am. Jur, A.L.R.
	* State-specific - Strong's NC Index

* Digests - collections of short case abstracts
	* West - Key number
	* Lexis - Search by topic or headnote
* Citators - Tell you if a case is still good law
	* helps find all cases that cite an authority
* Dicta - anything outside of the holding in the opinion
* Statute trumps common law as an authority
* A ruling by a state agency is a decision on an issue (from an article I judge) -- different from an agency ruling -- still subordinate to state's highest court
* When a federal ct looks at a state issue, it adopts the position of the highest court in that state
* Trial court has zero persuasive value since it is lowest on the authority chain
### Citation & Attribution

### Using introductory signals (Bluebook B3)
* [No signal]
	* Authority directly states the proposition
	* Identifies the source of a quotation
	* Identifies authority
* "e.g.": Other authorities that state the proposition but that don't add anything to the issue. For demonstrating consensus on a settled matter of law.

* Supporting signals:
	* Accord
	* See also
	* Cf.
* Signal suggesting a comparison

* Lead with the most binding authority

## September 27
### Explanatory Parentheticals
* Efficient way to convey info about a cited case.
* Use present participles.
* Not capitalized unless it's a quote
* If it's a quote, start it with a capital even if the quote didn't start with a cap.
* No period inside paren unless it's a quote, then always include the period (in brackets)
* In a string cite, start with the highest authority and proceed to the lowest.

### Research assignment
* **Issue**
	* Under North Carolina law 
		* does a buyer in the ordinary course of business have title to the goods purchased when the seller mistakenly acquired those goods?
		* ...when the original owner mistakenly entrusted those goods to the merchant?
		* Did Wong entrust the good to Segal when he took the wrong box from the trunk?
		* Did Wong transfer title to Segal when she dropped off the box of electronics.
		* Does title of property pass to BOCB when property without good title is sold by a merchant who usually deals in those kinds of goods
* Take legally significant terms (BOCB, "good faith") out of issues, since that presumes a lot about the case.
* **Conversion**
	* *Peed v. Burleson*, 244 NC 437 (1956)

### Short form citations
* Id ("idem" -- same) - for the exact same source. Add the page or section # if different page or section (use "at [page number]", but no "at" for section number)
* Can use "Id" in a citation as a "see also"

### Presentation feedback
* Make sure to do reflection questions
* Use state reporters instead of regional reporters
* When there's nothing on point, focus on analogies
* Make sure every assertion is supported by evidence
* Be sure to incorporate policy discussion
* Introduce summary judgment

### Counter-analysis
