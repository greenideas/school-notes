# Wong Conversion Outline
## Issue
* Under North Carolina law, does conversion occur when a buyer purchases goods on consignment that the seller mistakenly sold against the original owner's wishes?

## Short answer
* No, apparently. 

## Analysis
* Roadmap

### Summary judgment
* Bradford will file a motion for summary judgment
* Summary judgment is proper if the evidence on record shows “that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A-1, Rule 56(c) (2011).
* LIBERTY MUTUAL INSURANCE CO. v. Judy Bass PENNINGTON and Rick Pennington (in word doc)

### Conversion
* Policy
* Definition
* Elements
	* The common law rule for conversion that the court used in *Variety Wholesalers, Inc. v. Salem Logistics Traffic Services, LLC* requires that:
		* Actor exercised the right of ownership without authorization **AND ONE OF THE FOLLOWING**
			* That he altered the condition of the goods **OR**
			* Excluded the owner's rights to her property
	* It's clear that Bradford both altered the condition of the goods and excluded Wong's use of the prototype, but the issue we need to resolve is whether Bradford had the right to do so, which is to say, whether he owned the prototype at that point.

### BOCB
* Definition: N.C. Gen. Stat. § 25-1-201 (9)
	* "Three essential elements must be present to make this statute operative: (1) an entrustment of goods to (2) a merchant dealing in goods of that kind, followed by a sale by that merchant to (3) a buyer in the ordinary course of business." Am. Clipper Corp. v. Howerton, 311 N.C. 151, 165, 316 S.E.2d 186, 194 (1984)
	* "It is clear that, for this subsection to be applicable, there must be three essential steps: (1) An entrustment of goods to (2) a merchant who deals in goods of that kind followed by a sale by such merchant to (3) a buyer in ordinary course of business. And the phrase ‘deals in goods' is to be construed as one who is engaged regularly in selling goods of the kind." Toyomenka, Inc. v. Mount Hope Finishing Co., 432 F.2d 722, 727 (4th Cir. 1970)

### Entrusting
* Definition: N.C. Gen Stat § 25-2-403 (2) & § 25-2-403 (3)
	* Act of manufacturer in giving possession of vehicle to dealer was an entrustment of vehicle, but once a sale was made by dealer to a buyer in the ordinary course of business, title passed from the manufacturer to the buyer, who then had the power to transfer to another the interest he received in the goods, and since he did assign security interest in the vehicle by the installment sales contract, finance company, as the assignee, had an interest or “title” in the vehicle which was superior to that of the manufacturer. American Clipper Corp. v. Howerton, 1984, 316 S.E.2d 186, 311 N.C. 151.
	* On the question of whether Hawkins was estopped to assert title to the vehicles because he delivered the certificates of title endorsed in blank to Thorne, the Court concluded that he was not on the ground that the endorsements of the assignments were not in compliance with the MVA. Am. Clipper Corp. v. Howerton, 311 N.C. 151, 160, 316 S.E.2d 186, 191 (1984)
	* Toyomenka, Inc. v. Mount Hope Finishing Co.
	* "Indeed, the UCC provides that entrustment may be completed, and title may pass, despite even the larceny of an entrustee. G.S. § 25-2-403(3)." N. Carolina Nat. Bank v. Robinson, 78 N.C. App. 1, 11, 336 S.E.2d 666, 672 (1985)

## Counter-analysis
### Under American Clipper
* In American Clipper, the Court interpreted  G.S. § 25-2-326(1)(b), (3) as requiring a manufacturer who wanted to keep a secured interest in goods it consigned to "post signs on the vehicle or elsewhere identifying itself as the owner"
		* Wong's prototype had a sticker on it that said: "PROPERTY OF PENELOPE WONG.  PROPRIETARY!  NOT FOR RESALE."
		* Since she clearly signaled her intention to retain title to the prototype, Segal couldn't have then transferred it to Bradford.
* § 25-2-326 (and hence this interpretation) would only apply if Segal's sale to Bradford was a "sale on approval," which given "The fine print" on the receipt, "All Sales are Final. No Warranties and No Returns," it wasn't.

### Under Toyomenka
* *Toyomenka v. Mount Hope Finishing Co.* United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, 1970 **PERSUASIVE**
	* ‘No right, title, or interest may be acquired as the result of an unauthorized or wrongful sale, gift, exchange, pledge, mortgage, or other transfer of property by a bailee in possession, even though to an innocent purchaser. The bailor is not divested of his title by such an unauthorized act and may recover the property or its value from the vendee or transferee in any appropriate form of action.’ (AmJur, quoted in the opinion)
	* Since Wong didn't herself mislead Bradford, she isn't responsible for Segal's mistake & retained title to the prototype.
* In Toyomenka, the reason there was no entrusting was because the delivery was to the wrong person. Had Toyomenka's goods been delivered to the right person in the first place, entrustment would have occurred, and title transfer could have proceeded to Mount Hope. In the present circumstances, Ms. Wong delivered the goods herself to the one and only consignee, so the Toyomenka court's analysis doesn't apply.
