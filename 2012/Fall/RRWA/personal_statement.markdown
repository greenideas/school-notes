# A Personal Statement, Autobiography, and Travelogue in Song
## by Matt Henry
1. Paul Simon, "Graceland" - This was the first tape I ever asked my parents for. I got it for Easter when I was eight. It's still one of my favorite albums.
* Bob Dylan, "Visions of Johanna" - Like a lot of high school students, I got into Dylan around the same time as I started to think about the world outside of my hometown, and what the hell I was going to do out there.
* Woody Guthrie, "Hobo's Lullaby" - I was in a country cover band in college called Cowboys & Engines. We used to cover this song.
* Jonathan Richman, "New England" - I'm not from New England, but I did live in Boston for a couple of years, and New England is my favorite place in the world. Bonus: I saw Jonathan Richman play at the Farm Sanctuary in CA for vegan Thanksgiving, and he played this song for me.
* Matt Henry, "Boston Song" - It's rare that I write a song that I don't hate. This is one of a small handful of such songs.
* Tom Waits, "Tom Traubert's Blues (Four Sheets to the Wind in Copenhagen)" -  I often used to take a Greyhound bus between Boston & NYC. I had to get up at 4AM to catch the first one. No matter what direction you approach 4AM from, this is the right song to accompany that journey.
* Cub, "New York City" - There have obviously been a million and one songs written about NYC, but this is my favorite. I listened to it non-stop when I was getting ready to move there.
* Lungs of a Giant, "Polluted Man" - I managed this band for a little while when I lived in Brooklyn. I was terrible at it, although I did get them a couple of important shows.
* Belle & Sebastian, "Dog on Wheels" - My best buddy in the world is a mini schnauzer in a wheelchair. It's possible that including a song called "Dog on Wheels" here is a little too on the nose.
* Midlake, "Bandits" - Despite having just purchased a house in Durham, Yahoo! gave me an offer I couldn't refuse. I listened to this record constantly throughout the interview process and, eventually, on the cross-country drive.
* Quasi, "California" - I really, really hated living in California. I left as soon as I could without having to pay Yahoo! back for the relocation money I got for the move out there.
* Old Crow Medicine Show, "Wagon Wheel" - As soon as I started making concrete plans to come back east to NC, I wore this song out. It also inspired the dogwood tree tattoo I have on my left shoulder.
* George Jones, "The Grand Tour" - I love George Jones so much. This song means a heck of a lot to me.
* Belle & Sebastian, "Legal Man" - I listened to this song *a ton* while studying for the LSAT, including on the morning of the test in the car on the way to the testing facility.
* The Dubliners, "Rocky Road to Dublin" - My last hurrah before starting school (while I still had leisure time and disposable income) was a trip to Ireland. If you ever want to see lots of pictures of landmarks from the history of Irish republicanism, I'm your guy. 
* Megafaun, "The Longest Day" - This is a pretty tune by one of my favorite local bands. I love being back in NC. I feel incredibly lucky that I get to do what I'm doing now.
