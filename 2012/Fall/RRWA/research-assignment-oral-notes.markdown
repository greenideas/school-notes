## Issue
* Under North Carolina law, does conversion occur when a buyer purchases goods on consignment that the seller sold by mistake?

## Definitions
* **Buyer in the ordinary course of business** - "means a person that buys goods in good faith, without knowledge that the sale violates the rights of another person in the goods . . . ." 
	* "Only a buyer that takes possession of the goods or has a right to recover the goods from the seller under Article 2 of this Chapter may be a buyer in ordinary course of business."
	* N.C.G.S. 25-1-201
* **Entrusting** -
	*  "Any entrusting of possession of goods to a merchant who deals in goods of that kind gives him power to transfer all rights of the entruster to a buyer in ordinary course of business."
	* "'Entrusting' includes any delivery and any acquiescence in retention of possession regardless of any condition expressed between the parties to the delivery or acquiescence and regardless of whether the procurement of the entrusting or the possessor's disposition of the goods have been such as to be larcenous under the criminal law."
	* N.C.G.S. 25-2-403

## Cases
### American Clipper v. Howerton
* "Transaction wherein manufacturer, rather than delivering the vehicle to the dealer for resale, put the vehicle in the possession of the debtor for the purpose of a future sale which would be contemporaneous with a sale between the manufacturer and the dealer was not a “sale or return” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code, but was a “consignment” which required the manufacturer to post signs on the vehicle or elsewhere identifying itself as the owner if it wished to prevail against the financing company as a creditor of the consumer as the ultimate consignee. G.S. § 25-2-326(1)(b), (3)." Am. Clipper Corp. v. Howerton, 311 N.C. 151, 316 S.E.2d 186 (1984)
* Since Wong didn't intend to sell the prototype in the first place, and Segal only took possession of the prototype by mistake (and didn't pay Wong anything for it up front), the transaction with Bradford was not a resale. Rather, it was a consignment. 
* Wong's prototype had a sticker on it that said: "PROPERTY OF PENELOPE WONG.  PROPRIETARY!  NOT FOR RESALE."
* The *American Clipper* court quotes *Nasco Equipment Co. v. Mason* to say "It seems likely that plaintiff has mistakenly relied on the traditional North Carolina rule that the mere entrustment to a bailee by an owner of a chattel would not preclude the owner from recovering possession as against the mortgagee of the bailee since the bailee had no title and the mortgagee did not occupy the position of a bona fide purchaser. *The exception to this rule lay in circumstances where the owner clothed the mortgagor with the indicia of ownership.*" (emphasis added)
* In the context of *American Clipper* the sticker identifies Wong as the ultimate "creditor" here.

### Toyomenka v. Mount Hope Finishing Co.
* The relationship between Toyo & Mt. Hope was bailor & bailee, just like Wong & Segal.
* Wong isn't responsible for the error that Segal made in selling the prototype to Bradford: "Toyomenka did nothing itself to mislead Mount Hope and, as has been observed, the act of negligence by Wilmington cannot be imputed to it. Whitford v. Lane, supra. Nor did Mount Hope take any action in reliance on anything Toyomenka did to its prejudice."
* The court (quoting AmJur): ‘No right, title, or interest may be acquired as the result of an unauthorized or wrongful sale, gift, exchange, pledge, mortgage, or other transfer of property by a bailee in possession, even though to an innocent purchaser. The bailor is not divested of his title by such an unauthorized act and may recover the property or its value from the vendee or transferee in any appropriate form of action.’

### Variety Wholesalers, Inc. v. Salem Logistics Traffic Services, LLC
* The definition of conversion the court uses here is: "an unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right of ownership over goods or personal chattels belonging to another, to the alteration of their condition or the exclusion of an owner's rights." (quoting from Peed v. Burleson)
* Unauthorized exercise of the right of ownership (which this was, under *Toyomenka*) **AND**
	* Alteration of the condition of the goods **OR**
	* Exclusion of the owners rights.
* Bradford's use was all of these things. It was unauthorized (from *Toyomenka*), and it altered the condition of the goods (in that the prototype was destroyed), and excluded Wong's rights (since the prototype was destroyed and even the parts were discarded).

### Hoch v. Young
* Further clarifying the Court's understanding of conversion, endorsing Prosser's definition: "Where there has been no wrongful taking or disposal of the goods, and the defendant has merely come rightfully into possession and then refused to surrender them, demand and refusal are necessary to the existence of the tort. When demand is made, and absolute, unqualified refusal to surrender, which puts the plaintiff to the necessity of force or a lawsuit to recover his own property, is of course a conversion."
* So even though Bradford "rightfully" came into possession of the prototype, since the property remained Wong's (under Toyomenka & American Clipper), her demand for its return & Bradford's refusal establishes conversion.

## Issue
* Under North Carolina law, does conversion occur when a buyer purchases goods on consignment that the seller mistakenly sold against the original owner's wishes?

## Answer
* Yes. When a third party seller sells the original owner's property due to a mistake for which the original owner isn't at fault, the buyer is liable for conversion.

## Analysis
* The common law rule for conversion that the court used in *Variety Wholesalers, Inc. v. Salem Logistics Traffic Services, LLC* requires that:
	* Actor exercised the right of ownership without authorization **AND ONE OF THE FOLLOWING**
		* That he altered the condition of the goods **OR**
		* Excluded the owner's rights to her property

### First element -- Bradford was not authorized to exercise ownership of the prototype
* Two cases show why Wong retained rightful ownership of the prototype:
	* *American Clipper Corp. v. Howerton* Supreme Court of NC, 1984 **MANDATORY**
		* In this case, the Court interpreted  G.S. § 25-2-326(1)(b), (3) as requiring a manufacturer who wanted to keep a secured interest in goods it consigned to "post signs on the vehicle or elsewhere identifying itself as the owner"
		* Wong's prototype had a sticker on it that said: "PROPERTY OF PENELOPE WONG.  PROPRIETARY!  NOT FOR RESALE."
		* Since she clearly signaled her intention to retain title to the prototype, Segal couldn't have then transferred it to Bradford.
	* *Toyomenka v. Mount Hope Finishing Co.* United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, 1970 **PERSUASIVE**
		* ‘No right, title, or interest may be acquired as the result of an unauthorized or wrongful sale, gift, exchange, pledge, mortgage, or other transfer of property by a bailee in possession, even though to an innocent purchaser. The bailor is not divested of his title by such an unauthorized act and may recover the property or its value from the vendee or transferee in any appropriate form of action.’ (AmJur, quoted in the opinion)
		* Since Wong didn't herself mislead Bradford, she isn't responsible for Segal's mistake & retained title to the prototype.

### Second element -- Bradford altered the condition of the goods
* Bradford doesn't dispute that he destroyed the prototype in the robot fight, so this element is satisfied.

### Third element -- Excluding Wong's right to her property
* Again, Bradford doesn't dispute that he destroyed the prototype.

### Alternative analysis of conversion
* *Hoch. v. Young*
	* The Court expressed an alternative understanding of conversion, in *Hoch. v. Young*
	* Here, endorsing Prosser's definition: "Where there has been no wrongful taking or disposal of the goods, and the defendant has merely come rightfully into possession and then refused to surrender them, demand and refusal are necessary to the existence of the tort. When demand is made, and absolute, unqualified refusal to surrender, which puts the plaintiff to the necessity of force or a lawsuit to recover his own property, is of course a conversion."
	* So even though Bradford "rightfully" came into possession of the prototype, since the property remained Wong's (under Toyomenka & American Clipper), her demand for its return & Bradford's refusal establishes conversion.

## Conclusion
* Bradford had all of the elements of conversion required by *Variety*. It was unauthorized (from *American Clipper* & *Toyomenka*), and it altered the condition of the goods (in that the prototype was destroyed), and excluded Wong's rights (since the prototype was destroyed and even the parts were discarded).
* We can also establish conversion by showing that she retained title to the prototype and that Bradford refused to return it when asked.
