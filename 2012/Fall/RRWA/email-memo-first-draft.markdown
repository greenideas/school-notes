### The memo
To: Prof. Aaron HarmonFrom: Matt HenryDate: 9/16/2012Subject:  Camm Corto, File #2012-50; Validity of expired commissioner's vote

#### Issue:
Is a vote cast by a commissioner valid when that commissioner's term has expired and a successor has been appointed but not yet sworn in?

#### Answer:
Yes. A commissioner still has the authority to vote until her successor is sworn in.

#### Facts:
The North Carolina Real Estate Commission voted 5-4 to revoke Camm Corto's real estate broker's license on August 14, 2012. The term of Hally Hangroun, one of the commissioners who voted to revoke, expired on August 1, 2012. Her successor was appointed on August 13, 2012, but did not take the oath of office until August 17, 2012.

#### Analysis:
The North Carolina Constitution, in describing the authority of appointed public officers, grants such authority "until other appointments are made or, if the offices are elective, until their successors are chosen and qualified," N.C. Const. Art. VI, § 10. Since the additional requirement that the successor be "qualified" applies only to elected officers, Article VI appears to terminate an appointed officer's commission at the time a successor is appointed. However, the North Carolina General Statutes covering public officers requires "[a]ll officers [to] continue in their respective offices until their successors are elected or appointed, and duly qualified," N.C. Gen. Stat. § 128-5. The legislature more clearly states that additional qualification is required of elected and appointed officers alike. However, we still need more detail about the nature of that qualification.

According to the North Carolina Constitution, one qualification that officers must have is that they take an oath of office "[b]efore entering upon the duties of an office," N.C. Const. Art. VI, § 7. The legislature echoed that requirement, saying that "every officer . . . shall take all said oaths before entering on the duties of the office," N.C. Gen. Stat. § 128-7. Both the North Carolina Constitution and the North Carolina General Statutes appear to extend an appointed officer's authority until her successor is both appointed and sworn in. With the statutory background in place, there is a remaining question of how the courts view decisions made by appointed officers during this 'hold over' period.

In *Baxter v. Danny Nicholson, Inc.*, the Supreme Court of North Carolina specifically addressed the question of whether actions taken by appointed state commission officers whose terms had expired and whose successors had been appointed but not yet sworn in are valid. In that case, the Court rejected the defendant's argument that an officer's successor needed to be both appointed *and* qualified, interpreting Article VI, Section 7 of the North Carolina Constitution and North Carolina General Statutes § 127-8 as being intended to prevent vacancies on state commissions. *Baxter v. Danny Nicholson, Inc.*, 363 N.C. 829; 690 S.E.2d 265 (2010). The court determined that the legislature intended to allow officers to retain their authority until their successors are sworn in order to allow the State's work to continue uninterrupted. This decision explicitly overturned a decision by the Court of Appeals of North Carolina that held that an appointed officer's actions after a successor has been appointed are void, even before that successor has been sworn in. *Baxter v. Danny Nicholson, Inc.* 191 N.C. App. 168, 661 S.E.2d 892 (2008).

The North Carolina Supreme Court's decision in *Baxter* applies directly to the present circumstances. Even though Commisioner Hangroun's term as commissioner had expired, and her replacement had been appointed, her vote to revoke Corto's license was valid because her successor had not yet been sworn in, so her 'hold over' authority was still in effect.
