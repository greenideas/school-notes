# Criminal Law--Cases and Materials
## Basic Principles of the Criminal Law
* The basic elements of criminal law are:
	1. A set of rules telling people how not to act or how they are compelled to act
	2. Those rules are binding on everyone in a community and derive their authority from that community
	3. In the event that an individual breaks one of those rules, he may be subject to sanction.
* Those elements apply equally well to any other kind of law.
* What separates criminal law from civil law is that criminal offenses elicit moral condemnation from the community
* ?? But doesn't the same go for some civil rules? Aren't I also morally obligated to pay my debts and fulfill contracts?

### Sources of criminal law
* There is no nationwide criminal code.
* Every jurisdiction's criminal laws are constrained by the US Constitution.
* Model Penal Code (MPC)
	* Created by the American Law Institute
	* Wrote a whole criminal code from scratch from 1952-1962.
	* 34 states have subsequently rewrote their criminal codes and incorporated parts of the MPC.
* The criminal code in various jurisdictions may be based more on the (English) common law or on the MPC
* The US Constitution defines no crimes--only limitations on how states may punish behavior.

### Justifications for punishment
* *Consequentialist* - actions are morally right if they have desirable outcomes
* *Nonconsequentialist* - actions are intrinsically morally right or wrong
	* *Retributivism* is a nonconsequentialist theory of punishment that makes the amount of punishment proportional to the amount of harm caused.

#### Regina v. Dudley and Stephens
* Queen's Bench Division 1884
* Two shipwrecked men killed another man at sea and ate him.

* **Parties**
	* Dudley - Captain
	* Stephens
	* Parker - victim, weakest condition, youngest
	* Brooks - Didn't consent to killing Parker
	* (? Yacht owner? Possible civil cause of action. Maybe criminally negligent? Reckless?)

* **Issues**
	* Is it self-defense if you kill someone to save your own life even though that person was not going to harm you? Conversely, is doing so murder?

* **Reasoning**
	* Hunger is not sufficient justification to commit a crime.
	* A soldier's duty is to sacrifice his life--not to preserve his own life--as such there is no moral obligation to preserve one's own life.
	* Compassion for the criminal in no way changes the definition of the crime.

* **Holding**
	* Dudley & Stephens murdered Brown. Sentenced to death.

* **Notes**
	* 5 theories of punishment
		1. General deterrence - deter others from committing the same (narrow) or (broad) similar crimes or any crime.
		2. Specific deterrence - deter that individual from committing the same (narrow) or any (broad) crime again.
		3. Rehabilitation - Drug rehab, vocational training, etc.
		4. Incapacitation - sequestering the criminal
		5. Retribution - inflict damage to offender to offset the harm to society -- without considering the circumstances under which the crime was committed

#### People v. Suitte
* NY State Supreme Ct, Appellate div. 1982, J. Lazer

* **Parties**
	* Suitte

* **Procedural History**
	* Suitte pleaded guilty to 4th degree possession of a weapon, sentenced to 30 days in jail and 3 years probation.
	* Suitte appealed the sentence asking for removal of the jail time.

* **Facts**
	* Suitte was found to have a  loaded .25 calibre automatic pistol while driving.
	* Pistol was licensed in NC, but not in NY.
	* He was aware he needed to register the weapon.
	* No prior convictions
	* Claimed to have the weapon for protection
	* Sentencing judge considered but rejected Suitte's reason for carrying.
	* Sentencing law had provisions for giving lighter sentences for character and cause as long as the defendant had not been convicted of a felony or Class A misdemeanor in the last 5 years.

* **Issue**
	* Was there abuse of discretion in sentencing?

* **Reasoning**
	* We can see abuse of discretion when a sentencing judge doesn't consider the purpose of punishment
	* No abuse of discretion
	* Sentencing court viewed discretion as the overriding principle
	* The judge has to look at the effect of a sentence not just on the defendant but on the community as a whole
	* Short but mostly unavoidable jail terms generally deter
	* The purpose of the law would be undermined by showing lenience to Suitte.

* **Rule**
	* Discretion is proper when the purposes of punishment are duly considered.

* **Holding**
	* Sentence is affirmed

* **Dissent**
	* O'Connor
	* The facts of the case argue for more leniency.
	* Other justifications for punishment should be considered

* **Notes**
	* Lazer: sentencing involves:
		1. The crime charged,
		2. The offender's circumstances, and
		3. The purpose of the punishment
	* Lazer: Purpose of the gun law was general deterrence
	* Lazer: Sentencing judges must weight the various purposes of punishment and there is no consensus view on how they should be ranked. This causes inconsistent sentencing for similar crimes.
	* Lazer: Sentencing judge's decision should receive deference on appeal, since she had first-hand knowledge of the case.
	* As a result, most of the time the only parts of sentences that are changed on appeal are those that rely on the discretion of the court.
	* This is the power to substitute discretion

## Constitutional limits on the power to punish
* Separation of powers
  * The legislature passes laws to reflect the will of the people
  * The judiciary protects non-majority, & long-term fundamental interests of
    the people as a whole by enforcing constitutional guarantees.

### Fourteenth Amendment Due Process: Void for Vagueness Doctrine
#### Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville
* SCOTUS 1972, J. Douglas
* Vague vagrancy law goes against 14th amendment due process as it ensnares poor people & nonconformists

* **Parties**
	* π: Papachristou
	* ∂: City of Jacksonville

* **Facts**
	* 5 consolidated cases--all violations of a Jacksonville vagrancy ordinance:
		1. Papachristou, Calloway, Melton, Johnson -- vagrancy 'prowling by auto'
			* Papachristou & Calloway (white women), Melton & Johnson (black men), sitting in Calloway's car.
			* Police claim to to have stopped them since they had stopped near a use car lot that had had many break-ins.
			* There was no evidence of a break-in that night.
			* Group was arrested for 'prowling by auto'
			* Only Papachristou had ever been arrested before (convicted of a municipal offense)
		2. Smith & Henry -- vagrancy 'vagabonds'
			* Smith & Henry (Henry isn't a petitioner) were arrested while waiting for a
			   friend to lend them a car so they could apply for jobs.
			* Smith was a part-time organizer for a black political group.
			* Smith was arrested several times but convicted once.
			* Henry was an 18yo kid with a clean record.
			* They had waited in a dry-cleaning shop but left when they were asked to.
			* They then walked back and forth on the block a few times.
			* Dry cleaner owners called over two police.
			* Police searched them & found nothing.
			* Police arrested them anyway since they had no ID & police didn't believe their story of what they were doing.
		3. Heath & codefendant -- vagrancy 'loitering' & 'common thief'
			* Heath had previous arrest, codefendant didn't.
			* Heath & codef were arrested when pulling up to Heath's girlfriend's house.
			* Police were already there arresting someone else.
			* They started to back out of the driveway when police told them to stop & get out of the car. 
			* They did.
			* They were searched & arrested, though police found nothing on them.
			* Heath was charged with 'common thief' since he was reputed to be a thief.
			* Codef was charged with loitering for standing in the driveway.
			* Police admitted codef was only standing in the driveway because they told him to. 
		4. Campbell -- vagrancy 'common thief''
		5. Brown -- vagrancy 'disorderly loitering on street' & 'disorderly conduct--resisting arrest with violence'

* **Procedural History**
	* 8 people convicted of vagrancy sentenced to fines & jail time (some of which was suspended)
	* Sentences affirmed by FL circuit court after consolidated appeal
	* Petition for cert to SCOTUS
 
* **Issue**
	* Is the Jacksonville vagrancy law defensible under the Constitution (is it void for vagueness)? 

* **Reasoning**
	* Rule of law requires that all citizens should be able to understand what the law commands or forbids them to do.
	* There is no intent requirement for the vagrancy law, so you don't have to intend to do anything wrong to be on the wrong side of it.
	* The law criminalizes being out of work, or walking at night too often, even if you happen to do that in order to help you sleep.
	* Prohibiting walking around 'without lawful purpose or intent' will ensnare many law-abiding people.
	* People who are likely to be arrested under this law are 'poor people, nonconformists, dissenters, idlers.' Such people acting as they will is what gives Americans the feeling of liberty under the Constitution.
	* Court said in 1876 that laws shouldn't empower police to arrest everybody and let the courts sort out who did anything wrong.
	* The vagrancy law gives too much discretion to police. No need to establish 'probable cause'
	* The law is a cudgel allowing Jacksonville to force people to conform to the lifestyle it demands.

* **Holding**
	* The vagrancy ordinance is 'void for vagueness.'  It doesn't give ordinary citizens fair notice that their conduct may be prohibited by the statute. It encourages unpredictable and inconsistent arrests and convictions. 

* **Rule**
	* Laws must not give so much discretion to law enforcement that a citizen can't predict what behavior might lead to arrest.

#### Kolender v. Lawson
* SCOTUS 1983, J. O'Connor

* **Parties**
	* π: Kolender - San Diego PD Chief of Police
	* ∂: Lawson - Arrested for not providing ID

* **Facts**
	* CA's § 647(e) requires people loitering on the street to provide 'credible & reliable' ID, and give a reason for being there when stopped by police under *Terry* criteria (reasonable suspicion of criminal activity).
	* ('credible & reliable' language isn't actually in § 647(e) itself but rather in gloss provided by the CA Ct. of App.)
	* Lawson on different occasions was stopped for walking near businesses after closing time as well as when businesses were open.
	* Under the law: 
		1. ID has to appear authentic & have contact information so the holder can be found later.
		2. Accounting for presence goes to establishing credibility of ID & contact info.
	* Lawson was detained or arrested ~15 times under this law, prosecuted twice & convicted once.

* **Procedural History**
	* Lawson brought a civil action to District Ct, in CA seeking declaratory judgment that § 647(e) was unconstitutional, enjoin enforcement of that statute, and take damages ($150k, according to following CSM article) from the officers who arrested him.
	* District court said § 647(e) was too broad since someone stopped without *probable cause* can't be punished for not identifying himself.
	* Ct enjoined enforcement, but denied damages since the officers were operating under the good faith understanding that the stops were lawful.
	* Appeals Ct. affirmed the judgment re: unconstitutionality.
	* Officers appealed to SCOTUS re unconstitutionality of § 647(e).

* **Issue**
	* Is CA's § 647(e) unconstitutional under void-for-vagueness?

* **Reasoning**
	* The most important aspect of void-for-vagueness is that it forces legislatures to establish rules delimiting discretion of law enforcement.
	* Without such rules, arrests may be unpredictable or discriminatory.
	* § 647(e) has no such standards regarding 'credible & reliable' ID, so it's up to the discretion of law enforcement.
	* This could lead to arbitrary arrests, or even suppression of 1st Amendment liberties & freedom of movement.
	* Discretion given under § 647(e) is 'the moment-to-moment judgment of the officer on his beat'
	* § 647(e) is a powerful tool to discriminate against unpopular groups.
	* The stop itself is constitutional as long as it meets *Terry* standards, but the ID requirement gives too much discretion.

* **Holding**
	* § 647(e) is unconstitutionally vague because it doesn't provide clear rules on how the law is to be obeyed.

* **Rule**
	* Laws must contain rules that limit the discretion of law enforcement so that suspects can know how to comply with those laws.
	
* **Notes**
	* *facial challenge* - challenging a law (or statute or govt action) in all applications. Contrast with challenge 'as applied.'
	* *Terry v. Ohio* said police could stop anyone on "reasonable suspicion" of criminal activity, and frisk anyone under reasonable suspicion that they were armed & dangerous. Such a stop is called a *Terry* stop.
	* SCOTUS claimed jurisdiction under U.S.C. § 1254(2): "By certification at any time by a court of appeals of any question of law in any civil or criminal case as to which instructions are desired, and upon such certification the Supreme Court may give binding instructions or require the entire record to be sent up for decision of the entire matter in controversy."

#### City of Chicago v. Morales
* SCOTUS 1999, Justice Stevens

* **Parties**
	* π: City of Chicago
	* ∂: Morales

* **Facts**
	* Chicago City Council passed a Gang Congregation Ordinance prohibiting "criminal street gang members" from "loitering" in public with each other or with anyone else.
	* City council held hearings on gang activity & heard testimony that drug activity, murder, & other violent crime was due to increased gang presence.
	* Gang presence intimidated other citizens.
	* Gangs loitered in order to establish control over territory, but violated no other laws while police were around.
	* Such loitering causes fear of harm to people & property.
	* Violation of the law requires 4 predicates:
		1. Police have to reasonably suspect that at least one of the two or more people present in a public place is a gang member.
		2. Those people must be loitering ("remaining in any one place with no apparent purpose").
		3. Officer must order people to disburse
		4. Any person present (gang member or not) must disobey the order
	* The person(s) disobeying the order are the violators.
	* The police order (General Order 92-4) mandating enforcement of the Ordinance attempted to limit discretion by 
		1. only allowing certain officers to make arrests under the Ordinance
		2. only enforcing the ordinance within areas identified as those where the presence of gang members has an effect on the activities of law abiding members of the community. The locations of those areas are not disclosed to the public.
	* Violation of the the Ordinance is punishable by a fine, jail time and community service.
	* The Ordinance was enforced for 3 years, with 89000 orders to disperse and 42000 people arrested. 

* **Procedural History**
	* Illinois Supreme Court ruled that the Ordinance was unconstitutionally vague.
	* City seeks cert. 

* **Issue**
	* Does the the Gang Congregation Ordinance violate 14th Amendment due process?

* **Reasoning**
	* A law prohibiting large groups of people to congregate while engaging in wanton, lawless behavior would be constitutional.
	* Loitering for innocent purposes is legal under the scope of the 14th Amendment
	* Staying in one place is as much a right as going from one place to another.
	* A law may be too vague because it either 
		1. Provides insufficient notice to enable citizens to comply with it, or
		2. Authorizes or encourages arbitrary & discriminatory enforcement.
	* "Apparent purpose" is not sufficiently clear as to what constitutes a legitimate reason to loiter.
	* The city obviously didn't mean to criminalize any instance of loitering in public in the same place as a gang member, but "apparent purpose" does not give adequate guidance to decide what behavior is innocent and what is threatening harm.
	* The order to disperse is itself unconstitutional if the loitering was lawful in the first place.
	* The police mandate requires officers to give the order to disperse without asking why the members are loitering. Since there can be no attempt under this mandate to establish reasonable suspicion, enforcement is unconstitutionally arbitrary.

* **Holding**
	* The Ordinance gives too much discretion to police and too little notice to citizens.

* **Dissent**
	* Scalia:
		* Police under some circumstances may constitutionally force crowds to disperse (lookie-loos at an accident) in the interest of public safety.
		* Public safety is harmed by congregating gang members.
		* Democratic choice to enact this statute.
		* The majority elevates the rights of gang members over the rights of law-abiding citizens.
	* Thomas:
		* Justices overrule the will of the people who live in the gang neighborhoods without themselves having to suffer the consequences of that decision.
		* Freedom to loiter isn't implicit in ordered liberty.

* **Notes**
	* Residents of the gang infested neighborhoods support laws like this since it saves gang members from themselves and the mandatory minimum sentences from the trouble they'd otherwise get into.

### Eighth Amendment: Cruel and Unusual Punishment and the Principle of Proportionality
* 8th Amendment says "Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted."

#### Kennedy v. Louisiana
* SCOTUS, 2008 J. Kennedy

* **Parties**
	* π: Kennedy
	* ∂: Louisiana

* **Facts**
	* Kennedy called 911 to report that his 8 year-old stepdaughter (LH) had been raped.
	* Claimed he was getting his son ready for school when he heard LH scream.
	* He said he went outside & found LH in the side yard.
	* Claimed that two neighborhood boys dragged her from the garage to the yard, held her down & raped her, and that he saw one of the boys ride away on a blue 10-speed.
	* Dr. at children's hospital said LH's injuries from the sexual assault were the worst he'd seen in his 4 years of practice.
	* LH insisted Kennedy was not her rapist, but the state was unsatisfied with his story and arrested him 8 days after the attack.
	* 4 months after the attack, LH admitted that Kennedy had raped her.
	* The morning after the rape, Kennedy gave LH some pills in orange juice & was overheard telling someone on the phone that she was a "young lady" now.
	* LH testified that Kennedy had instructed her to tell the story about the neighborhood boys.
	* During sentencing, SL, the cousin & goddaughter of Kennedy's ex-wife testified that he had sexually abused her three times when she was 8, and one time involved intercourse. She kept it secret for two years and didn't take legal action.
	* According to the LA aggravated rape law, Kennedy's rape of LH was aggravated because she was under 12 years old. Her age also added the option of a death sentence.

* **Procedural History**
	* Convicted in a jury trial & sentenced to death under LA law authorizing capital punishment of rape when the victim is <12 years old.
	* Kennedy argued in LA Supreme Ct that the death sentence for child rape is unconstitutional because it is disproportionate.
	* LA Supreme Court affirmed the sentence.
	* SCOTUS granted cert.

* **Issue**
	* Under the 8th amendment, can the death penalty be imposed for crimes that did not result in death and that were not intended to result in death?

* **Reasoning**
	* *Furman* says that 8th amdmt is based on the principle that punishment should be proportional to the crime.
	* Determination of proportionality has to consider evolving moral standards.
	* Constitution has a commitment to "decency and restraint" that is harmed when the law imposes death.
	* **Two arguments**:
		* *Consensus against capital child rape*:
			* Only 5 other states besides LA have capital child rape
			* LA argues that 6 states making child rape a capital offense in 13 years constitutes a trend.
			* Court says 6 states does not a trend make.
			* No one has been executed for child rape since 1964 and no one has been executed for any other non-homicide crime since 1963. (we're in 2008 now)
		* *Execution for child rape is disproportionate punishment (main argument)*:
			* The tension between ensuring consistency in applying capital sentences and the need to look at individual circumstances in capital cases leads the court to the belief that the number of instances in which capital punishment my be imposed must be limited.
			* Even though rape is probably the worst thing you can do to someone short of killing them, it still isn't as bad as murder.
			* Without a standard to consistently determine the "worst of the worst" cases of child rape, there is no non-arbitrary way to assign capital sentences for that crime.
	* **Does capital child rape meet the goals of retribution or deterrence?**
		* *Retribution*
			* Child rape is not sufficiently heinous to warrant capital punishment on retributivist grounds.
			* Capital sentences for child rape don't balance the harm to the victim, and may increase victim suffering since capital trials go on a long time which means a lot of reliving the trauma.
			* We also don't want child victims to have to make the adult moral choice of whether their rapist should be killed.
			* There is a "special risk of wrongful execution" in cases where the principal witness is a child.
		* *Deterrence*
			* Child sexual abuse is underreported.
			* One oft-cited (by victims) reason for this is fear of the consequences to the rapist.
			* If this is the case, more severe punishment may lead to more underreporting.
			* Also, by equating murder and child rape, as regards sentencing, you remove a disincentive for the rapist to just murder the victim.
	* The totality of these arguments shows that death is not a proportional punishment for child rape.

* **Holding**
	* Death is not a proportionate punishment for child rape, and is therefore unconstitutional under the 8th Amendment
 
* **Dissent**
	* Alito, joined by Roberts, Scalia, & Thomas
	* There is no national consensus that child rape shouldn't be punishable by death.
	* Imposing the death penalty for child rape is not inconsistent with "evolving standards of decency"
		* Many courts interpret *Coker* as meaning that no non-homicide crime can be punishable by death, and this prevents states from enacting laws to create such sentences.
		* The "no nonhomicide executions" argument ignores the period when all executions were illegal in the 60s.
		* Since the LA law establishing capital child rape, 50% (2/4) of child rape defendants were sentenced to death.
	* The arguments about further harm to the victim & underreporting are irrelevant to the question of proportionality and "cruel & unusual punishment"
	* The problem of unreliable child witnesses is not unique to child rape
	* Allowing capital punishment for child rape wouldn't expand the death penalty. The court had never prohibited it (me: but if we decide today that it's unconstitutional, then it was always unconstitutional. so letting states use capital punishment that way *is* an expansion)
	* Is an accomplice to capital murder more morally blameworthy than a repeat child rapist? (me: I totally buy this)
	* Somehow the mental anguish of the victim doesn't up the ante on the amount of harm caused so as to make proportionality seem more plausible.
	* Presumption is that laws are constitutional. The majority's arguments are insufficient to meet the burden.

#### Graham v. Florida
* SCOTUS 2010, J. Kennedy

* **Parties**
	* π: Graham
	* ∂: Florida

* **Facts**
	* Graham's parents were both crack addicts.
	* He had ADHD
	* Started drinking & smoking at age 9. Smoking pot at age 13.
	* When he was 16, he & 3 other school-age kids unsuccessfully tried to rob BBQ restaurant.
	* Showed contrition at trial, accepted a plea deal, & received two concurrent 3-year sentences. 
	* Released after 12 months.
	* Arrested again <6 months later.
	* Graham & two 20 year-old accomplices committed an armed home invasion.
	* That same night, the three men committed another robbery during which one of Graham's accomplices was shot.
	* Graham drove his accomplices to the hospital (in his father's car) & left them there, but a policeman asked him to stop as he was pulling away.
	* He accelerated, but hit a telephone pole.
	* He tried to flee on foot, but was caught.
	* Police found 3 handguns in his car.
	* He attempted to tell police that he wasn't involved in the home invasion, but the victim ID'd him.
	* He then admitted to being involved in two or three robberies before that night.
	* He was just 34 days away from turning 18.
	* Graham's probation officer said Graham had violated the terms of his probation by having a firearm, committing crimes, and associating with criminals.
	* At trial, he denied involvement in the home invasion, but admitted the probation violations, even though he was told that doing so might make him eligible for a life sentence on his old charges.
	* Evidence incl. witness testimony tied him to the home invasion & his attempt to flee police demonstrated his probation violation.
	* Judge at trial determined that Graham had no interest in turning his life around (since he had been given the opportunity to do so) and that it was in the best interests of the community that he go to jail for life.
	* Since FL doesn't have parole, every life sentence is effectively LWOP.

* **Procedural History**
	* Graham challenged the sentence in trial court on 8th amendment grounds, but that was denied.
	* 1st dist. ct. app.  of FL affirmed saying that the sentence was not grossly disproportionate with the crime.
		* they said he was nearly 18 & the offenses were violent.
		* he was incapable of rehabilitation.
	* SCOTUS granted cert.

* **Issue**
	* Can a juvenile be sentenced to LWOP for a nonhomicide crime?

* **Reasoning**
	* Court must consider evolving moral standards.
	* What counts as extremely cruel may change as moral consensus does, but the fact that the standard exists does not change. (*Kennedy*)
	* Courts have to look at the human elements of criminals.
	* Cruelty judgments turn on proportionality rather than whether they're inherently barbaric
	* Two kinds of proportionality cases:
		1. length-of-term challenges
			* *Harmelin* - "narrow proportionality principle" - sentence doesn't need to be strictly proportionate, just not grossly disproportionate.
			* Compare gravity of offense & severity of sentence. If it looks grossly disproportionate, look at sentences in similar cases. If it still looks grossly disproportionate, it is, and the sentence is cruel & unusual. 
		2. categorical application of death penalty
			* no death penalty for <18 year-old defendants or developmentally disabled.
			* no death penalty for nonhomicide crimes.
			* Find national consensus & see if it goes against such a sentence.
			* Based on that consensus, court should exercise judgment.
		* This case is novel because it's about a categorical challenge to a term-of-years sentence.
		* No threshold analysis, so the categorical approach must be applied.
			* **National consensus**
				* Amici say there is no national consensus, since states are all over the place on juvenile LWOP.
				* K says actual sentencing practice shows consensus against juvenile LWOP for nonhomicide offenses. Only 129 such sentences currently being served.
				* Of those 129, 77 are in FL. The rest are in just 10 states & the federal system.
				* 12 total jurisdictions give juves LWOP for nonhomicide offenses.
				* 26 states can impose the sentences but don't.
				* Sometimes juves are transferred to adult court & may then receive LWOP sentences, but that doesn't mean states intend for juves to get LWOP.
			* **Culpability & characteristics of the crime, criminal, & severity of punishment (proportionality, balancing)**
				* *Roper*: juves have less culpability (underdeveloped sense of responsibility, more susceptible to outside malign influence) & so should get less harsh sentences
				* psychologists have a hard time distinguishing b/w more & less culpable juves.
				* nonhomicide crimes are categorically less severe than homicide, so punishment should be categorically less severe, too.
				* juvenile + nonhomicide = twice diminished culpability
				* LWOP is similar to death:
					* irrevocable forfeiture of life
					* no hope of restoration
				* LWOP is worse for juves, since they'll have more years to spend in jail than adults who get LWOP.
			* **Reasons for punishment:**
				* *Retribution*: LWOP is 2nd most severe sentence, but juve nonhomicide isn't culpable enough to justify it
				* *Deterrence*: Lack of maturity & responsibility, cited re: culpability, also cuts against deterrence. With deterrent effect so limited, it can't be reason enough to justify LWOP for juve nonhomicides.
				* *Incapactiation*: we don't know well enough when someone is a juvenile how likely they are to reoffend.
				* *Rehabilitiation*: LWOP & rehabilitation are completely inconsistent in any case--not just juve LWOP.
			* Limited culpability, severity of punishment, & inadequacy of punishment theory all argue together that nonhomicide juve LWOP is cruel & unusual.
		* The state doesn't have to guarantee release, but there must be a realistic opportunity for release before completing a life sentence.
		* Some hardcases may be irredeemable, and they should never be let out, but you can't say that ahead of time when the offender is a juvenile.
		* **A categorical prohibition of nonhomicide juve LWOP is necessary**
			* *Legislation is insufficient protection against unfair sentencing*
				* FL's guards against unfair juve sentences are inadequate.
				* Nothing prevents a judge from deciding a juve offender has an "irretrievably depraved character" *Roper*
				* Graham's sentence was greater than what the prosecutor asked for. Judge decided Graham was incorrigible.
			* *No case-by-case approach either*
				* As above, we just can't know at the time of sentencing whether a juvenile is incorrigible.
				* Juveniles are uniquely disadvantaged in criminal trials.
					* They don't trust adults who are trying to help them.
					* Can't weigh long-term consequences.
			* *Categorical prohibition of LWOP gives defendants an opportunity to show growth*
	* Global consensus against nonhomicide juvenile LWOP

* **Holding**
	* 8th Amendment prohibits LWOP sentences for juveniles convicted of nonhomicide crimes.

* **Rule**
	* Cruelty judgments turn on proportionality rather than whether they're inherently barbaric

#### Miller v. Alabama
* SCOTUS 2012, J. Kagan
* Two 14-yo defendants convicted of murder & sentenced to LWOP.

* **Parties**
	* π: Miller
	* ∂: Alabama

* **Facts**
	* **Jackson**
		* Court had no discretion to impose any other sentence.
		*  Jackson, Shields & another boy went to rob a video store.
		* Jackson found out Shields had a sawed-off shotgun in his coat.
		* Jackson stayed outside at the beginning of the robbery.
		* Jackson went in & saw Shields continuing to ask for money.
		* He either told the cashier that "we ain't playin'" or Shields that "I thought you all was playin.'"
		* Cashier threatened to call police & Shields shot & killed her.
		* Boys then fled.
	* **Miller**
		* Miller & a friend, drunk & high, beat Miller's neighbor & set his trailer on fire.
		* The neighbor died.

* **Procedural History**
	* **Jackson**
		* Jackson charged with capital felony murder & aggravated robbery
		* Jackson moved to have the case tried in juvenile court, but due to his record of shoplifting & several car thefts, the motion was denied.
		* Appellate ct affirmed.
		* Statutory mandated sentence of LWOP.
		* Jackson filed a state habeas petition on the grounds that mandatory LWOP for a 14-yo goes against the 8th amendment.
		* Ct dismissed the petition & AR Supreme Ct. affirmed.
	* **Miller**
		* Tried initially as a juve, but moved to adult ct.
		* Convicted of murder in the course of arson.
		* Mandatory LWOP
		* AL Crim. App. Ct. affirmed. saying the punishment was proportional & that its mandatory nature was permissible under the 8th amendment.

* **Issue**
	* Is mandatory LWOP for juveniles cruel & unusual?

* **Reasoning**
	* Categorical ban on sentences that don't align culpabilty of offense & offender with severity of punishment (proportionality)
	* LWOP is like the death penalty (*Graham*) which means sentencing authorities are bound to consider characteristics of defendant.
		* None of *Graham* was crime-specific.
	* These two req'ments together disallow *mandatory* LWOP (since all discretion is removed)
	* Making LWOP mandatory doesn't allow consideration of culpability or capacity to change (as req'd by *Graham*)
	* AL & AR argued that *Harmelin*
		* *Harmelin* didn't have anything to do with juves, so its reasoning needn't apply. Just because something is appropriate for adults doesn't necessarily make it appropriate for kids.
	* “every juvenile will receive the same sentence as every other — the 17-year-old and the 14-year-old, the shooter and the accomplice, the child from a stable household and the child from a chaotic and abusive one.” 

* **Holding**
	* Mandatory LWOP for <18-yo defendants is cruel & unusual.

* **Rule**
