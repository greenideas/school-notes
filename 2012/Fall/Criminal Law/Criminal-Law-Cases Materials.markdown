# Criminal Law--Cases and Materials
## Basic Principles of the Criminal Law
* The basic elements of criminal law are:
	1. A set of rules telling people how not to act or how they are compelled to act
	2. Those rules are binding on everyone in a community and derive their authority from that community
	3. In the event that an individual breaks one of those rules, he may be subject to sanction.
* Those elements apply equally well to any other kind of law.
* What separates criminal law from civil law is that criminal offenses elicit moral condemnation from the community
* ?? But doesn't the same go for some civil rules? Aren't I also morally obligated to pay my debts and fulfill contracts?

### Sources of criminal law
* There is no nationwide criminal code.
* Every jurisdiction's criminal laws are constrained by the US Constitution.
* Model Penal Code (MPC)
	* Created by the American Law Institute
	* Wrote a whole criminal code from scratch from 1952-1962.
	* 34 states have subsequently rewrote their criminal codes and incorporated parts of the MPC.
* The criminal code in various jurisdictions may be based more on the (English) common law or on the MPC
* The US Constitution defines no crimes--only limitations on how states may punish behavior.

### Justifications for punishment
* *Consequentialist* - actions are morally right if they have desirable outcomes
* *Nonconsequentialist* - actions are intrinsically morally right or wrong
	* *Retributivism* is a nonconsequentialist theory of punishment that makes the amount of punishment proportional to the amount of harm caused.

#### Regina v. Dudley and Stephens
* Queen's Bench Division 1884
* Two shipwrecked men killed another man at sea and ate him.

* **Parties**
	* Dudley - Captain
	* Stephens
	* Parker - victim, weakest condition, youngest
	* Brooks - Didn't consent to killing Parker
	* (? Yacht owner? Possible civil cause of action. Maybe criminally negligent? Reckless?)

* **Issues**
	* Is it self-defense if you kill someone to save your own life even though that person was not going to harm you? Conversely, is doing so murder?

* **Reasoning**
	* Hunger is not sufficient justification to commit a crime.
	* A soldier's duty is to sacrifice his life--not to preserve his own life--as such there is no moral obligation to preserve one's own life.
	* Compassion for the criminal in no way changes the definition of the crime.

* **Holding**
	* Dudley & Stephens murdered Brown. Sentenced to death.

* **Notes**
	* 5 theories of punishment
		1. General deterrence - deter others from committing the same (narrow) or (broad) similar crimes or any crime.
		2. Specific deterrence - deter that individual from committing the same (narrow) or any (broad) crime again.
		3. Rehabilitation - Drug rehab, vocational training, etc.
		4. Incapacitation - sequestering the criminal
		5. Retribution - inflict damage to offender to offset the harm to society -- without considering the circumstances under which the crime was committed

#### People v. Suitte
* NY State Supreme Ct, Appellate div. 1982, J. Lazer

* **Parties**
	* Suitte

* **Procedural History**
	* Suitte pleaded guilty to 4th degree possession of a weapon, sentenced to 30 days in jail and 3 years probation.
	* Suitte appealed the sentence asking for removal of the jail time.

* **Facts**
	* Suitte was found to have a  loaded .25 calibre automatic pistol while driving.
	* Pistol was licensed in NC, but not in NY.
	* He was aware he needed to register the weapon.
	* No prior convictions
	* Claimed to have the weapon for protection
	* Sentencing judge considered but rejected Suitte's reason for carrying.
	* Sentencing law had provisions for giving lighter sentences for character and cause as long as the defendant had not been convicted of a felony or Class A misdemeanor in the last 5 years.

* **Issue**
	* Was there abuse of discretion in sentencing?

* **Reasoning**
	* We can see abuse of discretion when a sentencing judge doesn't consider the purpose of punishment
	* No abuse of discretion
	* Sentencing court viewed discretion as the overriding principle
	* The judge has to look at the effect of a sentence not just on the defendant but on the community as a whole
	* Short but mostly unavoidable jail terms generally deter
	* The purpose of the law would be undermined by showing lenience to Suitte.

* **Rule**
	* Discretion is proper when the purposes of punishment are duly considered.

* **Holding**
	* Sentence is affirmed

* **Dissent**
	* O'Connor
	* The facts of the case argue for more leniency.
	* Other justifications for punishment should be considered

* **Notes**
	* Lazer: sentencing involves:
		1. The crime charged,
		2. The offender's circumstances, and
		3. The purpose of the punishment
	* Lazer: Purpose of the gun law was general deterrence
	* Lazer: Sentencing judges must weight the various purposes of punishment and there is no consensus view on how they should be ranked. This causes inconsistent sentencing for similar crimes.
	* Lazer: Sentencing judge's decision should receive deference on appeal, since she had first-hand knowledge of the case.
	* As a result, most of the time the only parts of sentences that are changed on appeal are those that rely on the discretion of the court.
	* This is the power to substitute discretion

## Constitutional limits on the power to punish
* Separation of powers
  * The legislature passes laws to reflect the will of the people
  * The judiciary protects non-majority, & long-term fundamental interests of
    the people as a whole by enforcing constitutional guarantees.

### Fourteenth Amendment Due Process: Void for Vagueness Doctrine
#### Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville
* SCOTUS 1972, J. Douglas
* Vague vagrancy law goes against 14th amendment due process as it ensnares poor people & nonconformists

* **Parties**
	* π: Papachristou
	* ∂: City of Jacksonville

* **Facts**
	* 5 consolidated cases--all violations of a Jacksonville vagrancy ordinance:
		1. Papachristou, Calloway, Melton, Johnson -- vagrancy 'prowling by auto'
			* Papachristou & Calloway (white women), Melton & Johnson (black men), sitting in Calloway's car.
			* Police claim to to have stopped them since they had stopped near a use car lot that had had many break-ins.
			* There was no evidence of a break-in that night.
			* Group was arrested for 'prowling by auto'
			* Only Papachristou had ever been arrested before (convicted of a municipal offense)
		2. Smith & Henry -- vagrancy 'vagabonds'
			* Smith & Henry (Henry isn't a petitioner) were arrested while waiting for a
			   friend to lend them a car so they could apply for jobs.
			* Smith was a part-time organizer for a black political group.
			* Smith was arrested several times but convicted once.
			* Henry was an 18yo kid with a clean record.
			* They had waited in a dry-cleaning shop but left when they were asked to.
			* They then walked back and forth on the block a few times.
			* Dry cleaner owners called over two police.
			* Police searched them & found nothing.
			* Police arrested them anyway since they had no ID & police didn't believe their story of what they were doing.
		3. Heath & codefendant -- vagrancy 'loitering' & 'common thief'
			* Heath had previous arrest, codefendant didn't.
			* Heath & codef were arrested when pulling up to Heath's girlfriend's house.
			* Police were already there arresting someone else.
			* They started to back out of the driveway when police told them to stop & get out of the car. 
			* They did.
			* They were searched & arrested, though police found nothing on them.
			* Heath was charged with 'common thief' since he was reputed to be a thief.
			* Codef was charged with loitering for standing in the driveway.
			* Police admitted codef was only standing in the driveway because they told him to. 
		4. Campbell -- vagrancy 'common thief''
		5. Brown -- vagrancy 'disorderly loitering on street' & 'disorderly conduct--resisting arrest with violence'

* **Procedural History**
	* 8 people convicted of vagrancy sentenced to fines & jail time (some of which was suspended)
	* Sentences affirmed by FL circuit court after consolidated appeal
	* Petition for cert to SCOTUS
 
* **Issue**
	* Is the Jacksonville vagrancy law defensible under the Constitution (is it void for vagueness)? 

* **Reasoning**
	* Rule of law requires that all citizens should be able to understand what the law commands or forbids them to do.
	* There is no intent requirement for the vagrancy law, so you don't have to intend to do anything wrong to be on the wrong side of it.
	* The law criminalizes being out of work, or walking at night too often, even if you happen to do that in order to help you sleep.
	* Prohibiting walking around 'without lawful purpose or intent' will ensnare many law-abiding people.
	* People who are likely to be arrested under this law are 'poor people, nonconformists, dissenters, idlers.' Such people acting as they will is what gives Americans the feeling of liberty under the Constitution.
	* Court said in 1876 that laws shouldn't empower police to arrest everybody and let the courts sort out who did anything wrong.
	* The vagrancy law gives too much discretion to police. No need to establish 'probable cause'
	* The law is a cudgel allowing Jacksonville to force people to conform to the lifestyle it demands.

* **Holding**
	* The vagrancy ordinance is 'void for vagueness.'  It doesn't give ordinary citizens fair notice that their conduct may be prohibited by the statute. It encourages unpredictable and inconsistent arrests and convictions. 

* **Rule**
	* Laws must not give so much discretion to law enforcement that a citizen can't predict what behavior might lead to arrest.

#### Kolender v. Lawson
* SCOTUS 1983, J. O'Connor

* **Parties**
	* π: Kolender - San Diego PD Chief of Police
	* ∂: Lawson - Arrested for not providing ID

* **Facts**
	* CA's § 647(e) requires people loitering on the street to provide 'credible & reliable' ID, and give a reason for being there when stopped by police under *Terry* criteria (reasonable suspicion of criminal activity).
	* ('credible & reliable' language isn't actually in § 647(e) itself but rather in gloss provided by the CA Ct. of App.)
	* Lawson on different occasions was stopped for walking near businesses after closing time as well as when businesses were open.
	* Under the law: 
		1. ID has to appear authentic & have contact information so the holder can be found later.
		2. Accounting for presence goes to establishing credibility of ID & contact info.
	* Lawson was detained or arrested ~15 times under this law, prosecuted twice & convicted once.

* **Procedural History**
	* Lawson brought a civil action to District Ct, in CA seeking declaratory judgment that § 647(e) was unconstitutional, enjoin enforcement of that statute, and take damages ($150k, according to following CSM article) from the officers who arrested him.
	* District court said § 647(e) was too broad since someone stopped without *probable cause* can't be punished for not identifying himself.
	* Ct enjoined enforcement, but denied damages since the officers were operating under the good faith understanding that the stops were lawful.
	* Appeals Ct. affirmed the judgment re: unconstitutionality.
	* Officers appealed to SCOTUS re unconstitutionality of § 647(e).

* **Issue**
	* Is CA's § 647(e) unconstitutional under void-for-vagueness?

* **Reasoning**
	* The most important aspect of void-for-vagueness is that it forces legislatures to establish rules delimiting discretion of law enforcement.
	* Without such rules, arrests may be unpredictable or discriminatory.
	* § 647(e) has no such standards regarding 'credible & reliable' ID, so it's up to the discretion of law enforcement.
	* This could lead to arbitrary arrests, or even suppression of 1st Amendment liberties & freedom of movement.
	* Discretion given under § 647(e) is 'the moment-to-moment judgment of the officer on his beat'
	* § 647(e) is a powerful tool to discriminate against unpopular groups.
	* The stop itself is constitutional as long as it meets *Terry* standards, but the ID requirement gives too much discretion.

* **Holding**
	* § 647(e) is unconstitutionally vague because it doesn't provide clear rules on how the law is to be obeyed.

* **Rule**
	* Laws must contain rules that limit the discretion of law enforcement so that suspects can know how to comply with those laws.
	
* **Notes**
	* *facial challenge* - challenging a law (or statute or govt action) in all applications. Contrast with challenge 'as applied.'
	* *Terry v. Ohio* said police could stop anyone on "reasonable suspicion" of criminal activity, and frisk anyone under reasonable suspicion that they were armed & dangerous. Such a stop is called a *Terry* stop.
	* SCOTUS claimed jurisdiction under U.S.C. § 1254(2): "By certification at any time by a court of appeals of any question of law in any civil or criminal case as to which instructions are desired, and upon such certification the Supreme Court may give binding instructions or require the entire record to be sent up for decision of the entire matter in controversy."

#### City of Chicago v. Morales
* SCOTUS 1999, Justice Stevens

* **Parties**
	* π: City of Chicago
	* ∂: Morales

* **Facts**
	* Chicago City Council passed a Gang Congregation Ordinance prohibiting "criminal street gang members" from "loitering" in public with each other or with anyone else.
	* City council held hearings on gang activity & heard testimony that drug activity, murder, & other violent crime was due to increased gang presence.
	* Gang presence intimidated other citizens.
	* Gangs loitered in order to establish control over territory, but violated no other laws while police were around.
	* Such loitering causes fear of harm to people & property.
	* Violation of the law requires 4 predicates:
		1. Police have to reasonably suspect that at least one of the two or more people present in a public place is a gang member.
		2. Those people must be loitering ("remaining in any one place with no apparent purpose").
		3. Officer must order people to disburse
		4. Any person present (gang member or not) must disobey the order
	* The person(s) disobeying the order are the violators.
	* The police order (General Order 92-4) mandating enforcement of the Ordinance attempted to limit discretion by 
		1. only allowing certain officers to make arrests under the Ordinance
		2. only enforcing the ordinance within areas identified as those where the presence of gang members has an effect on the activities of law abiding members of the community. The locations of those areas are not disclosed to the public.
	* Violation of the the Ordinance is punishable by a fine, jail time and community service.
	* The Ordinance was enforced for 3 years, with 89000 orders to disperse and 42000 people arrested. 

* **Procedural History**
	* Illinois Supreme Court ruled that the Ordinance was unconstitutionally vague.
	* City seeks cert. 

* **Issue**
	* Does the the Gang Congregation Ordinance violate 14th Amendment due process?

* **Reasoning**
	* A law prohibiting large groups of people to congregate while engaging in wanton, lawless behavior would be constitutional.
	* Loitering for innocent purposes is legal under the scope of the 14th Amendment
	* Staying in one place is as much a right as going from one place to another.
	* A law may be too vague because it either 
		1. Provides insufficient notice to enable citizens to comply with it, or
		2. Authorizes or encourages arbitrary & discriminatory enforcement.
	* "Apparent purpose" is not sufficiently clear as to what constitutes a legitimate reason to loiter.
	* The city obviously didn't mean to criminalize any instance of loitering in public in the same place as a gang member, but "apparent purpose" does not give adequate guidance to decide what behavior is innocent and what is threatening harm.
	* The order to disperse is itself unconstitutional if the loitering was lawful in the first place.
	* The police mandate requires officers to give the order to disperse without asking why the members are loitering. Since there can be no attempt under this mandate to establish reasonable suspicion, enforcement is unconstitutionally arbitrary.

* **Holding**
	* The Ordinance gives too much discretion to police and too little notice to citizens.

* **Dissent**
	* Scalia:
		* Police under some circumstances may constitutionally force crowds to disperse (lookie-loos at an accident) in the interest of public safety.
		* Public safety is harmed by congregating gang members.
		* Democratic choice to enact this statute.
		* The majority elevates the rights of gang members over the rights of law-abiding citizens.
	* Thomas:
		* Justices overrule the will of the people who live in the gang neighborhoods without themselves having to suffer the consequences of that decision.
		* Freedom to loiter isn't implicit in ordered liberty.

* **Notes**
	* Residents of the gang infested neighborhoods support laws like this since it saves gang members from themselves and the mandatory minimum sentences from the trouble they'd otherwise get into.

### Eighth Amendment: Cruel and Unusual Punishment and the Principle of Proportionality
* 8th Amendment says "Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted."

#### Kennedy v. Louisiana
* SCOTUS, 2008 J. Kennedy

* **Parties**
	* π: Kennedy
	* ∂: Louisiana

* **Facts**
	* Kennedy called 911 to report that his 8 year-old stepdaughter (LH) had been raped.
	* Claimed he was getting his son ready for school when he heard LH scream.
	* He said he went outside & found LH in the side yard.
	* Claimed that two neighborhood boys dragged her from the garage to the yard, held her down & raped her, and that he saw one of the boys ride away on a blue 10-speed.
	* Dr. at children's hospital said LH's injuries from the sexual assault were the worst he'd seen in his 4 years of practice.
	* LH insisted Kennedy was not her rapist, but the state was unsatisfied with his story and arrested him 8 days after the attack.
	* 4 months after the attack, LH admitted that Kennedy had raped her.
	* The morning after the rape, Kennedy gave LH some pills in orange juice & was overheard telling someone on the phone that she was a "young lady" now.
	* LH testified that Kennedy had instructed her to tell the story about the neighborhood boys.
	* During sentencing, SL, the cousin & goddaughter of Kennedy's ex-wife testified that he had sexually abused her three times when she was 8, and one time involved intercourse. She kept it secret for two years and didn't take legal action.
	* According to the LA aggravated rape law, Kennedy's rape of LH was aggravated because she was under 12 years old. Her age also added the option of a death sentence.

* **Procedural History**
	* Convicted in a jury trial & sentenced to death under LA law authorizing capital punishment of rape when the victim is <12 years old.
	* Kennedy argued in LA Supreme Ct that the death sentence for child rape is unconstitutional because it is disproportionate.
	* LA Supreme Court affirmed the sentence.
	* SCOTUS granted cert.

* **Issue**
	* Under the 8th amendment, can the death penalty be imposed for crimes that did not result in death and that were not intended to result in death?

* **Reasoning**
	* *Furman* says that 8th amdmt is based on the principle that punishment should be proportional to the crime.
	* Determination of proportionality has to consider evolving moral standards.
	* Constitution has a commitment to "decency and restraint" that is harmed when the law imposes death.
	* **Two arguments**:
		* *Consensus against capital child rape*:
			* Only 5 other states besides LA have capital child rape
			* LA argues that 6 states making child rape a capital offense in 13 years constitutes a trend.
			* LA argued further that, since DP had previously been ruled unconstitutional, it hit the reset button on how states calibrated their DP laws after it was reinstated.
			* LA is the only state that actually gave anyone a capital sentence for child rape.
			* Court says 6 states does not a trend make.
			* No one has been executed for child rape since 1964 and no one has been executed for any other non-homicide crime since 1963. (we're in 2008 now)
		* *Execution for child rape is disproportionate punishment (main argument)*:
			* The tension between ensuring consistency in applying capital sentences and the need to look at individual circumstances in capital cases leads the court to the belief that the number of instances in which capital punishment my be imposed must be limited.
			* Even though rape is probably the worst thing you can do to someone short of killing them, it still isn't as bad as murder.
			* Without a standard to consistently determine the "worst of the worst" cases of child rape, there is no non-arbitrary way to assign capital sentences for that crime.
	* **Does capital child rape meet the goals of retribution or deterrence?**
		* *Retribution*
			* Child rape is not sufficiently heinous to warrant capital punishment on retributivist grounds.
			* Capital sentences for child rape don't balance the harm to the victim, and may increase victim suffering since capital trials go on a long time which means a lot of reliving the trauma.
			* We also don't want child victims to have to make the adult moral choice of whether their rapist should be killed.
			* There is a "special risk of wrongful execution" in cases where the principal witness is a child.
		* *Deterrence*
			* Child sexual abuse is underreported.
			* One oft-cited (by victims) reason for this is fear of the consequences to the rapist.
			* If this is the case, more severe punishment may lead to more underreporting.
			* Also, by equating murder and child rape, as regards sentencing, you remove a disincentive for the rapist to just murder the victim.
	* The totality of these arguments shows that death is not a proportional punishment for child rape.

* **Holding**
	* Death is not a proportionate punishment for child rape, and is therefore unconstitutional under the 8th Amendment
 
* **Dissent**
	* Alito, joined by Roberts, Scalia, & Thomas
	* There is no national consensus that child rape shouldn't be punishable by death.
	* Imposing the death penalty for child rape is not inconsistent with "evolving standards of decency"
		* Many courts interpret *Coker* as meaning that no non-homicide crime can be punishable by death, and this prevents states from enacting laws to create such sentences.
		* The "no nonhomicide executions" argument ignores the period when all executions were illegal in the 60s.
		* Since the LA law establishing capital child rape, 50% (2/4) of child rape defendants were sentenced to death.
	* The arguments about further harm to the victim & underreporting are irrelevant to the question of proportionality and "cruel & unusual punishment"
	* The problem of unreliable child witnesses is not unique to child rape
		* Also, this concern is more appropriately brought up in the legislature.
	* Allowing capital punishment for child rape wouldn't expand the death penalty. The court had never prohibited it (me: but if we decide today that it's unconstitutional, then it was always unconstitutional. so letting states use capital punishment that way *is* an expansion) 
	* Is an accomplice to capital murder more morally blameworthy than a repeat child rapist? (me: I totally buy this)
	* Somehow the mental anguish of the victim doesn't up the ante on the amount of harm caused so as to make proportionality seem more plausible.
	* Presumption is that laws are constitutional. The majority's arguments are insufficient to meet the burden.

#### Graham v. Florida
* SCOTUS 2010, J. Kennedy

* **Parties**
	* π: Graham
	* ∂: Florida

* **Facts**
	* Graham's parents were both crack addicts.
	* He had ADHD
	* Started drinking & smoking at age 9. Smoking pot at age 13.
	* When he was 16, he & 3 other school-age kids unsuccessfully tried to rob BBQ restaurant.
	* Showed contrition at trial, accepted a plea deal, & received two concurrent 3-year sentences. 
	* Released after 12 months.
	* Arrested again <6 months later.
	* Graham & two 20 year-old accomplices committed an armed home invasion.
	* That same night, the three men committed another robbery during which one of Graham's accomplices was shot.
	* Graham drove his accomplices to the hospital (in his father's car) & left them there, but a policeman asked him to stop as he was pulling away.
	* He accelerated, but hit a telephone pole.
	* He tried to flee on foot, but was caught.
	* Police found 3 handguns in his car.
	* He attempted to tell police that he wasn't involved in the home invasion, but the victim ID'd him.
	* He then admitted to being involved in two or three robberies before that night.
	* He was just 34 days away from turning 18.
	* Graham's probation officer said Graham had violated the terms of his probation by having a firearm, committing crimes, and associating with criminals.
	* At trial, he denied involvement in the home invasion, but admitted the probation violations, even though he was told that doing so might make him eligible for a life sentence on his old charges.
	* Evidence incl. witness testimony tied him to the home invasion & his attempt to flee police demonstrated his probation violation.
	* Judge at trial determined that Graham had no interest in turning his life around (since he had been given the opportunity to do so) and that it was in the best interests of the community that he go to jail for life.
	* Since FL doesn't have parole, every life sentence is effectively LWOP.

* **Procedural History**
	* Graham challenged the sentence in trial court on 8th amendment grounds, but that was denied.
	* 1st dist. ct. app.  of FL affirmed saying that the sentence was not grossly disproportionate with the crime.
		* they said he was nearly 18 & the offenses were violent.
		* he was incapable of rehabilitation.
	* SCOTUS granted cert.

* **Issue**
	* Can a juvenile be sentenced to LWOP for a nonhomicide crime?

* **Reasoning**
	* Court must consider evolving moral standards.
	* What counts as extremely cruel may change as moral consensus does, but the fact that the standard exists does not change. (*Kennedy*)
	* Courts have to look at the human elements of criminals.
	* Cruelty judgments turn on proportionality rather than whether they're inherently barbaric
	* Two kinds of proportionality cases:
		1. length-of-term challenges
			* *Harmelin* - "narrow proportionality principle" - sentence doesn't need to be strictly proportionate, just not grossly disproportionate.
			* Compare gravity of offense & severity of sentence. If it looks grossly disproportionate, look at sentences in similar cases. If it still looks grossly disproportionate, it is, and the sentence is cruel & unusual. 
		2. categorical application of death penalty
			* no death penalty for <18 year-old defendants or developmentally disabled.
			* no death penalty for nonhomicide crimes.
			* Find national consensus & see if it goes against such a sentence.
			* Based on that consensus, court should exercise judgment.
		* This case is novel because it's about a categorical challenge to a term-of-years sentence.
		* No threshold analysis, so the categorical approach must be applied.
			* **National consensus**
				* Amici say there is no national consensus, since states are all over the place on juvenile LWOP.
				* K says actual sentencing practice shows consensus against juvenile LWOP for nonhomicide offenses. Only 129 such sentences currently being served.
				* Of those 129, 77 are in FL. The rest are in just 10 states & the federal system.
				* 12 total jurisdictions give juves LWOP for nonhomicide offenses.
				* 26 states can impose the sentences but don't.
				* Sometimes juves are transferred to adult court & may then receive LWOP sentences, but that doesn't mean states intend for juves to get LWOP.
			* **Culpability & characteristics of the crime, criminal, & severity of punishment (proportionality, balancing)**
				* *Roper*: juves have less culpability (underdeveloped sense of responsibility, more susceptible to outside malign influence) & so should get less harsh sentences
				* psychologists have a hard time distinguishing b/w more & less culpable juves.
				* nonhomicide crimes are categorically less severe than homicide, so punishment should be categorically less severe, too.
				* juvenile + nonhomicide = twice diminished culpability
				* LWOP is similar to death:
					* irrevocable forfeiture of life
					* no hope of restoration
				* LWOP is worse for juves, since they'll have more years to spend in jail than adults who get LWOP.
			* **Reasons for punishment:**
				* *Retribution*: LWOP is 2nd most severe sentence, but juve nonhomicide isn't culpable enough to justify it
				* *Deterrence*: Lack of maturity & responsibility, cited re: culpability, also cuts against deterrence. With deterrent effect so limited, it can't be reason enough to justify LWOP for juve nonhomicides.
				* *Incapactiation*: we don't know well enough when someone is a juvenile how likely they are to reoffend.
				* *Rehabilitiation*: LWOP & rehabilitation are completely inconsistent in any case--not just juve LWOP.
			* Limited culpability, severity of punishment, & inadequacy of punishment theory all argue together that nonhomicide juve LWOP is cruel & unusual.
		* The state doesn't have to guarantee release, but there must be a realistic opportunity for release before completing a life sentence.
		* Some hardcases may be irredeemable, and they should never be let out, but you can't say that ahead of time when the offender is a juvenile.
		* **A categorical prohibition of nonhomicide juve LWOP is necessary**
			* *Legislation is insufficient protection against unfair sentencing*
				* FL's guards against unfair juve sentences are inadequate.
				* Nothing prevents a judge from deciding a juve offender has an "irretrievably depraved character" *Roper*
				* Graham's sentence was greater than what the prosecutor asked for. Judge decided Graham was incorrigible.
			* *No case-by-case approach either*
				* As above, we just can't know at the time of sentencing whether a juvenile is incorrigible.
				* Juveniles are uniquely disadvantaged in criminal trials.
					* They don't trust adults who are trying to help them.
					* Can't weigh long-term consequences.
			* *Categorical prohibition of LWOP gives defendants an opportunity to show growth*
	* Global consensus against nonhomicide juvenile LWOP

* **Holding**
	* 8th Amendment prohibits LWOP sentences for juveniles convicted of nonhomicide crimes.

* **Rule**
	* Cruelty judgments turn on proportionality rather than whether they're inherently barbaric

#### Miller v. Alabama
* SCOTUS 2012, J. Kagan
* Two 14-yo defendants convicted of murder & sentenced to LWOP.

* **Parties**
	* π: Miller
	* ∂: Alabama

* **Facts**
	* **Jackson**
		* Court had no discretion to impose any other sentence.
		*  Jackson, Shields & another boy went to rob a video store.
		* Jackson found out Shields had a sawed-off shotgun in his coat.
		* Jackson stayed outside at the beginning of the robbery.
		* Jackson went in & saw Shields continuing to ask for money.
		* He either told the cashier that "we ain't playin'" or Shields that "I thought you all was playin'."
		* Cashier threatened to call police & Shields shot & killed her.
		* Boys then fled.
	* **Miller**
		* Miller & a friend, drunk & high, beat Miller's neighbor & set his trailer on fire.
		* The neighbor died.

* **Procedural History**
	* **Jackson**
		* Jackson charged with capital felony murder & aggravated robbery
		* Jackson moved to have the case tried in juvenile court, but due to his record of shoplifting & several car thefts, the motion was denied.
		* Appellate ct affirmed.
		* Statutory mandated sentence of LWOP.
		* Jackson filed a state habeas petition on the grounds that mandatory LWOP for a 14-yo goes against the 8th amendment.
		* Ct dismissed the petition & AR Supreme Ct. affirmed.
	* **Miller**
		* Tried initially as a juve, but moved to adult ct.
		* Convicted of murder in the course of arson.
		* Mandatory LWOP
		* AL Crim. App. Ct. affirmed. saying the punishment was proportional & that its mandatory nature was permissible under the 8th amendment.

* **Issue**
	* Is mandatory LWOP for juveniles cruel & unusual?

* **Reasoning**
	* Categorical ban on sentences that don't align culpabilty of offense & offender with severity of punishment (proportionality)
	* LWOP is like the death penalty (*Graham*) which means sentencing authorities are bound to consider characteristics of defendant.
		* None of *Graham* was crime-specific.
	* These two req'ments together disallow *mandatory* LWOP (since all discretion is removed)
	* Making LWOP mandatory doesn't allow consideration of culpability or capacity to change (as req'd by *Graham*)
	* AL & AR argued that *Harmelin*
		* *Harmelin* didn't have anything to do with juves, so its reasoning needn't apply. Just because something is appropriate for adults doesn't necessarily make it appropriate for kids.
	* “every juvenile will receive the same sentence as every other — the 17-year-old and the 14-year-old, the shooter and the accomplice, the child from a stable household and the child from a chaotic and abusive one.” 

* **Holding**
	* Mandatory LWOP for <18-yo defendants is cruel & unusual.

* **Rule**
	* 
 
* **Dissent/Concurrence**
	* 

* **Notes**
	* 

### Equal Protection
 * 14th amendment § 1: "No State shall...deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."
 * No discrimination based on race unless 1) there is a "compelling state interest," and 2) the discrimination is "narrowly tailored" to that interest. *Strict scrutiny*
 * Gender discrimination needs only to pass intermediate scrutiny
 * Strict scrutiny only applies to *intentional* racial discrimination.
 * Non-intentional discrimination only needs to pass rational basis scrutiny.

#### McClesky v. Kemp
* SCOTUS, 1987, j. Powell

* **Parties**
	* π: McClesky
	* ∂: Kemp

* **Facts**
	* McClesky (a black man) convicted of 2x armed robbery and 1x murder in Superior Ct of Fulton County, GA
	* Robbed a furniture store & killed a white police officer in the course of the robbery
	* Had 3 accomplices. Everyone was armed.
	* McK went in front, other 3 in back.
	* McK made all of the customers lay face down on the floor
	* Other 3 bound the employees with tape
	* Store mgr was held at gunpoint & made to give over store receipts, his watch and $6.
	* The policeman, answering a silent alarm, came in the front door & started walking down the store's center aisle.
	* He was shot twice and was killed.
	* McK arrested 2 wks later for an unrelated offense and confessed his participation in the robbery but denied shooting the cop.
	* At least one of the bullets that hit the cop were fired from a gun that matched the description of McK's gun.
	* 2 witnesses said they heard McK confess to the killing.

* **Procedural History**
	* Trial ct convicted McK of murder.
	* GA needs aggravating circumstances in murder for for DP & there were 2 here: 1) murder during armed robbery & 2) murder of a police officer in the line of duty
	* jury considered aggravating and mitigating circumstances, though McK offered none of the latter.
	* Jury gave DP on the murder & consecutive life sentences on the 2x robbery
	* Court gave McK DP
	* McK appealed conviction & failed.
	* Filed habeas petition in Fed District Ct in N Dist. of GA.
	* One of his 18 claims was that GA gave DPs in a racially discriminatory manner (8th & 14th amendments).
	* Introduced as evidence a study showing GA's disparities in DP based on the race of the victim & to a lesser extent on D's race:
		* 11% get DP with white victims, but only 1% get DP if the victim was black
		* 4% of black Ds get DP vs. 7% of white Ds
		* 22% get DP when D is black & victim is white; 8% when both D & victim are white; 1% when both D & victim are black; and 3% when D is white and victim is black
		* Prosecutors sought DP in 70% of trials where D was black & victim was white; 32% when both D & victim were white; 15% when both were black; and 19% when D was white and victim was black
		* Taking 39 nonracial variables into account, Ds who kill white people were 4.3x more likely to get DP
		* Black Ds 1.1x more likely to get DP

* **Issue**
	* Can statistical evidence of sentencing discrepancies be used to demonstrate equal protection violation?

* **Reasoning**
	* **II-A** - McK's claim that the court discriminated
		* Burden in equal protection cases is on D to prove purposeful discrimination and that the discrimination had a "discriminatory effect"
		* McK needed to show that there was discrimination *in his case*
		* If McK were right, every DP given to a black D who murder a white person would be discriminatory.
		* Two reasons why we can't use statistics here:
			1. Statistics can be used to show bias in jury selection based on bias in the district from where the jurors are drawn, but without that evidence we have to assume a fair jury.
			2. Statistics can only be used when the decisionmaker can tell the court why no bias exists, but since the decisionmakers here are jurors, that can't happen. (Jurors can't be called to testify why they voted how they did.)
		* Also, under US & GA law, McK's crime is one that may carry a death sentence (me: this is either question-begging or vacuous)
	* **II-B** - McK's claim that the state discriminated
		* McK claims the state violated the EPC because it knew of the discriminatory application of DP but kept the DP in place, but for this McK would have to show that GA kept the DP *because of* the disparity rather than in spite of it (*Rational basis scrutiny*)
	* **III** - McK's claim that the sentencing system discriminated
		* Discretion in sentencing isn't unconstitutional. A jury can use its discretion to not convict, to convict of a lesser offense, or to give a non-capital punishment.
		* Decisions that go against a D can be contested, but decisions that go for D are final.
	* **III-C**
		* Disparities in sentencing aren't sufficient to show systemic discrimination.
		* Unexplained != invidious
		* Considering the safeguards in place to prevent discriminatory sentencing as well as the benefits of discretion to Ds, the statistical study does not show excessive risk of racial bias.
		* Dissent says that discretion allows racial bias into trials:
			* No guidelines to rein in prosecutorial discretion
			* Juries don't have a list of aggravating factors or a way to balance them against each other.
		* But no such guidelines could be written that would apply from case to case but still be predictable (me: but if prosecutorial decisions aren't predictable now, what would we lose by attempting to create those guidelines?)
		* Reductio: We could end up applying this logic to discrepancies that aren't race-based (facial features of either the D or the victim--really anything that we can show with statistics)
		* McK's argument is best directed at legislators.
	  
* **Holding**
	* Evidence of racial disparity in sentencing does not constitute an Equal Protection violation
 
* **Dissent**
	*  JJ. Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun, Stevens
	* Brennan & Marshall: DP is given so arbitrarily that it should be abandoned altogether
	* All dissenters for the remainder below.
	* There's no way that, if McK had asked his lawyer what his chances were, that the answer would've been something to the effect that, since you're black and you killed a white cop, you're probably going to get the DP.
	* 4 reasons for majority opinion:
		1. Desirability of discretion
			* Discretion is there so the court can consider each D's circumstances & respect his autonomy & dignity
			* When race influences that discretion, this directly undermines that goal. If it looks like that discrimination is present, there should be a lower standard for determining if that is indeed the case.
		2. Safeguards against abuse of discretion [response omitted]
		3. Perils of broader challenges to fairness of sentencing
			* "[F]ear of too much justice" 
			* If there are other instances where discrepancies like this exist, why *wouldn't* we want to know about them and get rid of them?
			* Race is different from other characteristics. The court has gone to great lengths throughout its history in order to promote fairness in matters of race. Any racial bias is bad, and if it's in DP cases, it's especially bad.
			* Yes, no system of punishment will be perfect, but when the DP is at stake, we should hold the process to a higher standard.
			* The marginal benefit to the state of giving the DP vs LWOP is much less than the marginal loss to the defendant.
		4. Understanding the role of the judiciary [response omitted]
	* The Baldus study was so thorough that rejecting it sets too high a bar for subsequent studies.

#### State v. Russell
* Supreme Ct. of MN 1991, J. Wahl

* **Parties**
	* π: State of MN
	* ∂: Russell

* **Facts**
	* MN § 152.023 subd. 2 says that anyone found with 3+ grams of crack cocaine is guilty of a 3rd degree offense. Same result under the same law for anyone possessing 10+ grams of powder cocaine.
	* Max penalty for 3g of crack is 20 yrs. Max for 3g powder cocaine is only 5 years.
	* Sentencing guidelines for those amounts are 48 mos for crack & 12 mos prison and probation.
	* Ds are 5 black men convicted under MN § 152.023 subd. 2
 	* State argued the purpose of the law was to regulate crack & cocaine distribution & that the amounts covered in the law reflected what "street level" dealers would be carrying.

* **Procedural History**
	* In trial ct, D moved to dismiss on the grounds that MN § 152.023 subd. 2 violates equal protection.
	* Trial ct. said crack is used mostly by black Ds and powder cocaine by white Ds. Thus black Ds end up getting much harsher sentences than white Ds.
	* Trial ct. found no rational basis for the sentencing disparity between crack & cocaine powder. Equal protection is violated. 
	* Motion to dismiss was granted.
	* Trial ct. certified question for the ct of appeals.

* **Issue**
	* Do laws that create racial disparities in sentencing violate equal protection?

* **Reasoning**
	* Laws challenged under equal protection have to meet the standard that they:
		1. Have a legitimate purpose, and
		2. Legislators reasonably believed the law would serve that purpose
	* MN has additional standards such that:
		1. Any classifications made in a law must be "genuine and substantial"
		2. Those classifications must relate to the purpose of the law--there has to be some real connection between the group under classification and the legal remedy
		3. The purpose of the statute must be legitimately achievable.
	* Even if MN § 152.023 subd. 2 passes muster in other states, it doesn't meet the MN restrictions.
	* State fails to distinguish between users of crack and powder cocaine.
		* State's argument was that the 3g/10g level was the minimum amount it thought demonstrated an intent to distribute for each drug.
			* Those amounts came from informants and word-of-mouth all funneled anecdotally through one witness rather than through empirical study
			* MN Dept. of Public Safety Office of Drug Policy didn't buy this distinction either, saying that most powder cocaine users also distributed.
		* State further argued that crack was more addictive than powder cocaine and has a narcotics officer (not a scientist) testify to that effect.
			* A chemist testified that crack had the same effect as using cocaine intravenously, so there's no distinction there.
		* State argued that crack was the cause of more violent crime than powder cocaine.
			* The violence has more to do with gang involvement in crack distribution than with its pharmacology.
	* The distinction the law makes is also irrelevant to the law's purpose. 
		* There's no evidence that by setting the threshold at 3g for crack, we're not just arbitrarily punishing users as if they were dealers.
		* <10g of powder cocaine can be turned into much more than 3g of crack.
	* By defining intent to distribute as possessing a certain quantity, you make the charge tautologous and irrefutable--no need to actually prove intent

* **Holding**
	* No rational basis for the discrepancy in sentencing, so law violates equal protection.
 
* **Dissent**
	* Majority replaces its own presumed reasoning for the law for the legislature's actual reasoning.
	* Majority's assumption that crack & cocaine are the same thing is debatable.
	* MN court is not empowered to define appropriate punishment--just to determine what activity may be criminalized.
	* Presumption should be in favor of the legislature.
	* D didn't prove that there was racial discrimination--that the law was created because of rather than in spite of disparate effects for different races.
	* Social problems don't yield to the kind of empirical analysis the majority wants done.

## The Actus Reus Requirement
* Dalton: Wrote explicit narratives about sexual torture of minors. Jailed for child pornography, even though he wrote them as part of court-mandated therapy.

### Acting vs. thinking
#### Wisconsin v. Mitchell
* SCOTUS 1993, Rehnquist

* **Parties**
	* π: Wisconsin
	* ∂: Mitchell

* **Facts**
	* Several young black men decided to do a reverse "Mississippi Burning"
	* A young white boy walked by and Mitchell & the others beat him severely & stole his shoes.

* **Procedural History**
	* Mitchell was convicted of aggravated battery
	* His sentence was increased under a WI law that enhances the sentence when the victim is selected because of his race (or religion, color, sexual orientation . . . ).
	* Mitchell appealed the sentence on 1st amendment grounds.
	* Appeals Ct. denied the appeal, but WI SC reversed.

* **Issue**
	* Does a punishment-enhancing law that considers racial motivation for a crime violate the 1st amendment?

* **Reasoning**
	* WI argued it wasn't punishing thought, but action. Assault isn't speech.
	* Mitchell argued that since the only difference between the assault he committed and others was his bigoted motive, so the extra punishment violates the 1st amendment.
	* Motive *is* a valid factor in determining sentencing.
	* Judges need the discretion to impose harsher punishments in aggravated circumstances.
	* Previous SCOTUS cases have allowed racial hatred to be a factor in sentencing.
	* Mitchell argues that reasoning doesn't apply since the problem is with the law enshrining the sentencing guidelines--not with judges' discretion.
	* The WI statute was written because of the extra harm caused by crime motivated by race. Also greater risk of retaliation (i.e. more violence).
	* State's interest in preventing this is sufficient justification for its punishment-enhancement law.

* **Holding**
	* Reversed. Racist motive for a crime may be used to punish that crime more severely.

### Acting on one's own vs. acting under state compulsion
#### Martin v. State
* When the police took Martin from his home & made him stand on the highway, they couldn't then punish him for being drunk in public.

### Acting voluntarily vs. acting involuntarily
* Habitual acts are considered voluntary even when the actor is unaware she is performing them.

#### State v. Decina
* Ct. of App. NY, 1956

* **Parties**
	* π: State
	* ∂: Decina

* **Facts**
	* Decina was driving when he started to feel a seizure coming on.
	* He was unable to pull over before losing control and drove his car into a group of six schoolgirls, killing 4.
	* The car continued until crashing into a store, causing further injuries.

* **Procedural History**
	* Convicted in trial court, overruling a demurrer.
	* Appellate ct. upheld the decision on the demurrer ("reversed on the law?")

* **Issue**
	* Is Decina criminally liable for the harm he caused while he was effectively unconscious?

* **Reasoning**
	* The guilty act here isn't the striking of the girls or the final crash, but rather the decision to get in the car while knowing the risk his condition posed.
	* We don't want to say that drunk drivers shouldn't be held accountable for injuries they cause while intoxicated. Rather, we punish them simply for getting in the car knowing the risk of causing such injury.

* **Holding**
	* Because he was driving despite knowing the risk his condition posed, he is liable for the harm he caused.
 
* **Dissent**
	* There is a gap in the law here, and Decina should not be punished for it (this incident occurred before there were special licensing criteria for epileptics). 
	* He wasn't impaired when he got in the car and had no reason to believe, other than based on probability, that he was going to have a seizure at that time.
	* Since he didn't know he was going to have a seizure and there's no restriction on his license preventing him from driving, we can't hold him accountable.
	* The law prohibits reckless operation of a motor vehicle, and the reckless operation was not something Decina was in control of.
	* The language of the law is overbroad and it would be hard to know when it's okay to drive so there are due process reasons to contest the law.

### Acting vs. Failing to Act: Liability for Omissions
* Criminal liability for omission when ∂ (1) had a legal duty to act and (2) the ability to act
* Someone may have a legal duty to act when:
	1. there is a special relationship b/w ∂ and the victim (husband & wife, master & servant)
	2. there is a contract explicitly creating such a duty
	3. there is a statutory duty
	4. ∂ creates the risk of harm to the victim
	5. ∂ without any duty voluntarily enters into a duty

#### Establishing the duty to act
##### People v. Beardsley
* MI 1907, McAlvay, J.C. 

* **Parties**
	* π: People
	* ∂: Beardsley

* **Facts**
	* ∂ was with a woman who wasn't his wife in his home. They drank a lot.
	* The woman (Burns) sent a boy to get her some camphor and morphine.
	* ∂ noticed her taking the morphine & tried to knock it out of her hand & he and the boy also destroyed some of the pills
	* ∂ later called the boy to have her brought to the basement room of another guest (Skoba) so he could watch her
	* Skoba later became concerned about her condition and called a marshall & a doctor who determined that she had died.

* **Procedural History**
	* ∂ was convicted of manslaughter

* **Issue**
	* Is ∂ liable for failure to act when there is no special relationship b/w ∂ and victim. 

* **Reasoning**
	* π said that since Burns was in ∂'s home, he had a duty to care for her.
	* Lots of cases establish that a duty exists when there is a special relationship between ∂ and the victim.
	* Similarly, ∂ can volunteer for that duty.
	* Not every moral duty is a legal duty, but every legal duty is a moral duty.
	* Burns's being in ∂'s home created no such relationship.
	* If it was two men, no one would say such a relationship existed.

* **Holding**
	* No special relationship between ∂ and victim, so no duty to act, therefore no liability for the failure to act.

* **Rule**
	* ∂ must have a special relationship to the victim in order to be liable for failure to act. If ∂ & victim have such a relationship & ∂'s failure to act results in victim's death, ∂ is liable for manslaughter.

##### Commonwealth v. Howard
* Superior Ct. of PA 1979, Judge Hoffman

* **Parties**
	* π: Commonwealth
	* ∂: Howard

* **Facts**
	* ∂ lived with her daughter & boyfriend (Watts).
	* Watts repeatedly beat the daughter & subjected her to "sadistic abuse"
	* One night while Watts was beating the daughter, she hit her head on some furniture.
	* ∂ couldn't wake her up the next day.
	* ∂ made up a story to explain the injuries.
	* PA law: Involuntary manslaughter iff victim dies due to ∂'s reckless or negligent action whether or not that act was legal

* **Procedural History**
	* 

* **Issue**
	* 

* **Reasoning**
	* Liability can be for failure to act when there is a duty to act.
	* Parents have a duty to protect their children
	* ∂ is responsible for not intervening in her daughter's abuse.
	* The severity of the girl's injuries, and failure to intervene in the abuse or to alert the authorities constitute gross negligence.

* **Holding**
	* Conviction affirmed. ∂'s failure to act was grossly negligent.

* **Rule**
	* Failure to act must be reckless or grossly negligent.
 
##### Commonwealth v. Pestinikas
* Superior Ct. of PA, 1992, J. Wieand
* Couple took a sick old man in, took all of his money & starved him to death

* **Parties**
	* π: Commonwealth
	* ∂: Pestinikas 
	
* **Facts**
	* Kly was gravely ill & made arrangements with ∂s for his funeral.
	* He went to stay with ∂s after leaving the hospital.
	* Drs gave ∂s care instructions for Kly & a Rx to fill for him.
	* ∂s verbally agreed to give the requisite care.
	* ∂ didn't fill the prescription, told a visiting nurse she wasn't needed, kept Kly in a room where he was exposed to the elements & had no bathroom.
	* ∂s had their names added to Kly's back account
	* Over a year, ∂s took out more than $30k of Kly's money
	* ∂s called an ambulance who found Kly's emaciated corpse.
	* ∂ said she had given Kly cookies & OJ the morning of his death but autopsy showed he hadn't eaten for 39 hours & cause of death was dehydration & starvation
	* He suffered.

* **Procedural History**
	* ∂ convicted of 3rd degree murder
	* ∂ appealed saying evidence was insufficient & jury instructions were incorrect

* **Issue**
	* Is ∂ liable for failure to act when the duty to act is established by contract?

* **Reasoning**
	* ∂ contended verbal agreement was insufficient to establish duty to act.
	* Contractual obligation is sufficient to establish duty to act.
	* Oral agreement was sufficient to establish contract.
	* ∂s had a duty to act.
	* If ∂s maliciously withheld food, they would be liable for murder

### Acting vs Having a Status: Status Crimes
#### Robinson v. California
* SCOTUS 1962, J. Stewart
* Addiction is a status

* **Parties**
	* π: Robinson - has track marks, convicted of drug addiction
	* ∂: California

* **Facts**
	* CA law outlawed using **OR** being addicted to narcotics
	* policeman noticed π's arms had track marks
	* cop said π admitted occasional drug use
	* π denies this conversation happened & said the tracks were from an allergy when he was in the military

* **Procedural History**
	* π was convicted in trial ct under addiction law
	* trial judge instructed jury that it was illegal to use or be addicted to drugs
	* addiction, though a diachronic condition, can be established with a synchronic observation
	* judge said he was guilty if he was either using *or* addicted

* **Issue**
	* Can a law punish someone for their ongoing, passive status.

* **Reasoning**
	* We wouldn't make a law punishing a disease (say, leprosy) though a state may compel afflicted individuals to get treatment.
	* Such a law would violate 8th & 14th amendments
	* Addiction is an illness, so we can't punish it.

* **Holding**
	* Addiction is not a punishable offense.
 
* **Dissent**
	* J. Clark
	* Addiction is volitional.
	* Addicts are more likely to commit other crimes.

#### Jones v. City of Los Angeles
* 9th circuit, 2006. C.J. Wardlaw
* Homelessness is a status

* **Parties**
	* π: Jones
	* ∂: City of Los Angeles

* **Facts**
	* 6 homeless men
	* One of πs (Purrie) was fined one day for violating the law, then arrested a month later on the same spot for failing to pay the fine (which he couldn't afford)
	* πs are all too poor to afford shelter. some are working. some are sick. some are mentally ill.

* **Procedural History**
	* πs wanted an injunction against enforcement (b/w 9PM & 6:30AM) of a vagrancy law that made it illegal to sit or lay down on public sidewalks & streets
	* πs claimed that LA's law made being homeless (a status) a crime.
	* District ct. found for the city.
	* πs appealed.

* **Issue**
	* Can acts arising out of a chronic status be punished?

* **Reasoning**
	* πs were not on Skid Row by choice. (welfare stipend wasn't enough to afford shelter.)
	* ∂ said the law was okay because sleeping on benches was okay.
	* Other cities with similar laws require violators to also do something else wrong at the same time as they're lying down (e.g. obstructing foot traffic) or limiting enforcement to certain geographic areas.
	* More homeless in LA than there are shelter beds, so some people will necessarily be on the street.
	* From *Robinson* and *Powell*, involuntary statuses can't be punished.
	* Homelessness is an involuntary, chronic condition.
	* Dissent says the crime punishes acts, but πs obviously have to sleep sometime & they don't have anywhere they can legally do so, so what's really being punished is their status.
	* Whatever acts contributed to πs' homelessness, they're not proximate enough to the offenses to call the homelessness volitional.
	* 8th amendment *doesn't* prohibit avoidable offenses often committed by homeless (obstructing traffic, building shelters) **LIMITING PRINCIPLE**

* **Holding**
	* Overturned. πs should get at least a narrow injunction of the homelessness law.

* **Rule**
	* Inevitable actions arising out of chronic statuses are not punishable.
 
* **Dissent**
	* LA's law targets conduct (e.g. sitting)
	* Just because indivs aren't fully covered by government benefits, we should still be able to punish them
	* πs didn't show that they couldn't get shelter on the specific nights they were arrested

## Mens Rea
* The mental state given by the definition of an offense (the scienter or intent requirement)
* Common law names "willfully" "maliciously" "corruptly" "intentionally" "knowingly" "recklessly" and "negligently" as kinds of mens rea.
* MPC is more narrow:
	1. Purposely
	2. Knowingly
	3. Recklessly
	4. Negligently
* (1) - (4) have a logical relationship to each other & always mean the same thing
* Under MPC, if no other mens rea can be proved, proving "recklessness" is sufficient

### Regina v. Cunningham
* UK 1957, J. Byrne

* **Parties**
	* π: Regina
	* ∂: Cunningham

* **Facts**
	* ∂ "maliciously" made Sarah Wade inhale coal gas
	* ∂ stole the gas meter from Wade's house but didn't turn off the gas.
	* The gas partially asphyxiated Wade while she slept

* **Procedural History**
	* Judge at trial instructed jury that "malicious" just meant "wicked"

* **Issue**
	* Was ∂'s action both "unlawful" *and* "malicious"?

* **Reasoning**
	* Maliciousness requires:
		1. An intent to do the specific harm done
		2. **OR** recklessness regarding that harm--i.e. ∂ knew his behavior could cause harm but did it anyway
	* Trial judge incorrectly instructed jury.

* **Holding**
	* Overturned.

* **Rule**
	* "Maliciousness" requires:
		1. An intent to do the specific harm done
		2. **OR** recklessness regarding that harm--i.e. ∂ knew his behavior could cause harm but did it anyway

### Statutory interpretation
* Some crimes include a description of a mental state but it's not clear which element of the crime the mental state modifies

#### United States v. Yermian
* SCOTUS 1984, J. Powell
* Knowingly making false statements not knowing they're being made to the federal government

* **Parties**
	* π: United States
	* ∂: Yermian

* **Facts**
	* 18 U.S.C. § 1001 prohibits making false statements to a federal agency
	* ∂ made false statements on a DoD questionnaire. 
	* ∂ had been convicted of mail fraud but didn't disclose it.
	* ∂ said he had been employed at 2 companies at which he never worked
	* Form had a "true to the best of my knowledge" clause
	* ∂ admitted knowing of the falsity of those statements
	* ∂ said he didn't know the form was going to the gov't

* **Procedural History**
	* ∂ convicted of making false statements x3
	* ∂ requested that jury be instructed that ∂ needed to know of gov't jurisdiction
	* 9th circuit ct of app. reversed, saying dist. ct. didn't give jury that instruction
	* ct. of app. interpreted "knowingly & willingly" to apply both to the falsity of the statement and to the circumstance that those statements are being given to a gov't agency

* **Issue**
	* Does π have to prove ∂ knew statement was false **AND** knew of agency's jurisdiction. Does "knowingly & willingly" apply just to giving false statements or does it also apply to giving those statements to a govt agency?

* **Reasoning**
	* II
		* A
			* The fed agency language in § 1001 is meant to establish jurisdiction--congress didn't intend "knowingly & willingly" to apply to it
			* "k & w" only applies to the making of false statements
			* π says legislative history is unpersuasive
	* III
		* Reading § 1001 as requiring knowledge of the jurisdiction would be weird 

* **Holding**
	* Reversed. Both legislative history & the language of § 1001 show that knowledge of jurisdiction isn't reqd for guilt.
 
* **Dissent**
	* Rehnquist, w/ Brennan, Stevens, & O'Connor
	* Legislative history data is pretty sparse here.
	* Ambiguity in a statute has to favor ∂s.

#### Holloway v. United States
* SCOTUS 1999, J. Stevens

* **Parties**
	* π: Holloway
	* ∂: United States

* **Facts**
	* In carjackings, π and accomplice would go up to a car, accomp would pull a gun & threaten to shoot if vic didn't hand over keys
	* Accomp said he would've used the gun if a vic had given him a "hard time"
	* ∂ once punched a victim in the face, but there was no other violence

* **Procedural History**
	* Trial jury found π guilty of 3x carjacking & other offenses related to stealing cars
	* District judge told jury that govt had to prove π took the cars with an intent to cause death or srs bodily harm to the car's owner
	* Jury instruction said that, if π had intended to cause death or srs bodily harm if the vic didn't comply, that was sufficient, even if there was no death or srs bodily harm.
	* π said this was inconsistent with the text of the statute
	* Dist. judge said conditional intent was legit
	* Ct. of App. affirmed

* **Issue**
	* In the carjacking law, does "with intent to cause death or serious bodily harm" require that unconditionally ∂ intend death or that ∂ intended to cause death in service of the carjacking?

* **Reasoning**
	* Statutory construction starts with the words the legislature used
	* Then look at the purpose of the statute
	* Question is whether the carjacking law meant to prohibit people from pointing guns at car owners with the intent to shoot them if they don't hand over the keys.
	* π clearly had such an intent
	* Intent may be conditional or unconditional
	* π says the law intended the latter, so there has to be some attempt to harm or kill.
	* Context of the law shows that the mental state, i.e. the intent, was meant to modify the taking of the car. If the taker is ready to kill when he takes the car, he is guilty.
	* Law was intended to be a strong deterrent and the strict reading enhances that effect
	* Congress would've known about *People v. Connors* which said that conditional intent to kill was sufficient mens rea
	* An attacker can't condition violence on a requirement he has no right to impose

* **Holding**
	* Affirmed. Conditional intent to cause death or serious bodily harm is sufficient, even if death or srs bodily harm isn't caused
 
* **Dissent**
	* Scalia
	* Intent, in normal usage, can't be conditional upon something actor hopes will not occur
	* Intent is a state of mind wherein the actor attempts to accomplish some result by some course of action.
	* One can't seek to accomplish something they hope won't happen
	* "Intent to kill if resisted" is not "intent to kill"
	* Words of the statute are the best indication of the legislative intent.
	* If there's ambiguity, we need to favor ∂

### Intent
* Common law intent:
	1. Actor's conscious purpose is to cause a result or engage in prohibited conduct
	2. **OR** Actor knows with virtual certainty that actions will cause social harm
* MPC uses "purposely" to denote (1) and "knowledge" to denote (2)
* "natural & probable consequences" doctrine is a shortcut to proving intent

#### State v. Fugate
* OH Ct. of App. 1973, Kerns

* **Parties**
	* π: State (OH)
	* ∂: Fugate

* **Facts**
	* ∂ entered a garage with a loaded shotgun.
	* Hit the owner of the garage with the barrel of the shotgun, ordered him into the basement and shot him dead

* **Procedural History**
	* ∂ convicted of armed robbery & 1st deg murder
	* ∂ appealed saying killing wasn't done "purposely"

* **Issue**
	* Can intent be proved without knowledge of ∂'s mental state?

* **Reasoning**
	* Intent is mental, so must be inferred from the observable circumstances surrounding the act.
	* Intent can never be proved by a 3rd person's testimony.
	* Intent to kill can be inferred when the "natural and probable consequence of a wrongful act is to produce death and such intent can be deduced from the circumstances" e.g. instrumentality & the nature of the fatal wound.
	* Facts on record (weapon & wound) support intent.

* **Holding**
	* Intent to kill can be inferred when the "natural and probable consequence of a wrongful act is to produce death and such intent can be deduced from the circumstances" e.g. instrumentality & the nature of the fatal wound.
 
### Knowledge
* MPC: Actor has "knowledge" of a fact when he is aware of the fact or has a true belief that the fact exists.
* Some jurisdictions equate actual knowledge with wilful blindness or deliberate ignorance.

#### United States v. Jewell
* 9th Circuit Ct. of App. 1976, Browning

* **Parties**
	* π: United States
	* ∂: Jewell

* **Facts**
	* 21 U.S.C. §§ 841 and 960 require positive knowledge that controlled substances are involved in each offense
	*  ∂ drove 110 pounds of marijuana into the US in a secret compartment between the trunk & the rear seat.
	* Circumstances were such that it's possible infer that ∂ knew about the marijuana in the compartment.
	* Alternatively possible to infer that he didn't know but did know of the possibility and avoided learning for certain.

* **Procedural History**
	* Trial jury was instructed that ∂ could be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt even if he didn't know the care he was driving had drugs in the trunk since he had to avoid looking in the trunk.
	* ∂ says this instruction was incorrect.

* **Issue**
	* Is positive knowledge required to establish "knowledge" or is wilful ignorance sufficient?

* **Reasoning**
	* Avoiding learning facts that would constitute positive knowledge of a crime counts as "knowledge" for mens rea.
	* The rule that wilful blindness == knowledge is everywhere in the law
	* One knows things one isn't completely certain
	* You have to know fairly well that criminal activity is occurring in order to avoid it and this is sufficient for "knowledge"
	* Allowing deliberate ignorance to be a defense would make it very difficult  to prove guilt & this would defeat the purpose of the drug laws
	* **LIMITING PRINCIPLE** Wilful ignorance is sufficient for knowledge only when there is a conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth.

* **Rule**
	* Wilful ignorance is sufficient to establish ''knowledge" as a mens rea

### Special problems in intent
#### Transferring intent
* Intent to do one thing can't be substituted as intent to do a completely different thing. Intent to steal rum isn't the same thing as intent to burn down a ship.
* *However*, if one performs an action with the intent to commit a crime against one person or thing and ends up committing that crime against a different person or thing, that intent may be transferred.

##### Regina v. Pemberton
* 1874, Coleridge

* **Parties**
	* π: Regina
	* ∂: Pemberton

* **Facts**
	* ∂ and friends were kicked out of a pub for being disorderly & all got in a fight outside the prosecutors window
	* ∂ threw a stone at one of his friends & it hit the prosecutors window

* **Procedural History**
	* Trial jury convicted ∂ of malicious injury to property.

* **Issue**
	* Can the intent to harm a person transfer to harming property

* **Reasoning**
	* ∂ was convicted of malicious injury to property, but that law requires that the injury be done "wilfully & intentionally"
	* If ∂ had thrown the stone recklessly, it would've been sufficient for guilt.
	* Since he threw it intending to injure a person and not property, he can't be convicted of injury to property.

* **Holding**
	* Conviction overturned.

* **Rule**
	* Intent can't transfer from one crime to another.
 
* **Concurrence**
	* ∂ broke the window without intent.

#### People v. Scott
* CA 1996, Brown
* Scott & Brown shot an automatic weapon into a public park intending to kill one person, but actually killing a bystander.

* **Parties**
	* π: People
	* ∂: Scott

* **Facts**
	* Calvin Hughes was dating Scott's sister.
	* They broke up & got in a physical fight.
	* Codefs came over & forced Hughes out of the sister's apartment.
	* Hughes came by the next day to get his stuff, & forced his way in to do so.
	* Later, Hughes & some of his friends & family were in a nearby park.
	* 3 cars entered the park. Codefs were in the first one & they opened fire on Hughes's group.
	* Some members of the group were hit & one, Jack Gibson, was killed.

* **Procedural History**
	* 1st trial had a deadlocked jury.
	* 2nd trial, π said ∂s had premeditated intent to kill Hughes but killed Gibson instead.
	* at π's request, ct. instructed jury on the CA transferred intent statute
	* jury convicted ∂s of 2nd deg murder & 2x assault with a firearm.
	* ∂s appealed saying transferred intent only applies when the charge is 1st deg murder of the unintended victim & not also attempted murder of the intended victim
	* Ct. of app. rejected that argument

* **Issue**
	* Under transferred intent doctrine, can a ∂ be convicted of the murder of the bystander as well as the attempted murder of the intended victim?

* **Reasoning**
	* CA common law, when a shooter misses his intended target, intent to kill one person is sufficient to convict for the murder of the actual victim.
	* When someone accidentally kills one person when they intend to kill another, society is harmed as much as if they intended victim was killed.
	* Common law notion of transferred intent persisted after CA adopted its murder statute
	* Intent is "used up" in its transference. Just because it's transferred to the murder of the bystander, it's still part of the attempted murder of the intended victim.
	* "transferred intent" doesn't mean that there is a literal transfer of intent. It's a legal fiction--not a finite resource. We have transferred intent for policy reasons.
	* ∂ argues that prosecuting for 1st deg murder of bystander as well as attempted murder of the intended victim is prosecuting the intent to kill two people. *People v. Birreuta* said someone who contemplates two murders is more culpable than someone who only intends one.
		* However, in *Birreuta*, the intended victim was killed (along with a bystander) so it's not necessary to use transferred intent.
		* Someone who intends to kill two people is more culpable than someone who intends to kill one and kills two by mistake. Using transferred intent to ascribe 1st degree intent to the bystander eliminates the distinction in culpability.
		* Courts have gone both ways on this.
		* But since only one person, the bystander, was killed, *Birreuta* is irrelevant.
	* The case law is clear here. ∂s intended the premeditated killing of one person, but killed a bystander instead. Under those circumstances, intent to kill the intended victim is transferred to the bystander.
	
* **Holding**
	* Conviction affirmed

* **Rule**
	* When one intends to kill one person but kills another instead, ∂ can be convicted of the murder of the actual victim as well as attempted murder of the intended victim.
	
#### Specific v. General Intent
##### People v. Atkins
* CA 2001, Chin

* **Parties**
	* π: People
	* ∂: Atkins

* **Facts**
	* ∂ told friends he hated Figgs & was going to burn down Figgs's house.
	* Neighbor saw ∂'s brother (David) drive a white truck into the area of Figgs's house, but couldn't tell if he had a passenger.
	* Neighbor saw the truck speed away a half-hour before seeing a fire near Figgs's house.
	* That night, one of ∂'s friends saw ∂ at David's house where he was very drunk.
	* Fire marshall found ∂'s wallet 40ft from where the fire started as well as a disposable lighter some beer cans and tire tracks.
	* ∂ later told the fire marshall that he & David drove to the ranch, saw a bunch of weeds & decided to burn them.
	* ∂ said it was a mistake & the fire just got out of control.
	* Fire marshall determined that the fire was intentionally set.

* **Procedural History**
	* At trial jury was instructed on arson: "willfully & maliciously" setting fires, as well as on lesser offenses. Jury was told that voluntary intoxication was not an excuse.
	* Said arson & lesser crimes were general intent & that intoxication isn't a defense.
	* Jury convicted of arson.
	* ∂ appealed saying voluntary intoxication shows he lacked the mens rea for arson.
	* Ct. of appeals overturned conviction, saying arson req'd a specific mental state to burn land. Jury instruction to disallow consideration of intoxication deprived ∂ of opportunity to defend.	

* **Issue**
	* Is voluntary intoxication a valid defense of general intent crimes?

* **Reasoning**
	* Voluntary intoxication can negate specific intent, but not general.
		* The distinction came about specifically to solve the problem of intoxicated ∂s.
		* Culpability is less when ∂ is drunk, but ∂ still needs to be punished.
	* General intent: intent just to commit an act, without intending any particular consequence of that act.
	* Specific intent: intent to commit an act specifically for the purpose of bringing about a particular consequence.
	* Arson is a general intent crime. ∂ didn't have to intend to burn the house--just to set the fire.
	* Arson statute doesn't require specific intent.

* **Holding**
	* Appeals ct. ruling rev'd. Conviction upheld.

* **Rule**
	* Voluntary intoxication is not a defense of a general intent crime, though it can be a defense for specifc intent.
	* Arson is a general intent crime.

### Strict Liability Crimes
* No mental state req'ment.

#### Morissette v. United States
* SCOTUS 1952, Jackson

* **Parties**
	* π: Morissette
	* ∂: US

* **Facts**
	* Gov't had a practice bombing range on a large wooded sparsely populated area of MI.
	* Practice bombs were filled with sand & enough black powder to make a visible puff of smoke.
	* Posted signs saying ''Danger--keep out--bombing range"
	* Still there were deer there and so lots of hunters
	* Spent casings were cleared away & piled up & rusting.
	* π was hunting & decided to salvage some casings--took three tons of them & flattened them out by driving a tractor over them.
	* Sold casings for $84.
	* π was a pretty good guy (veteran, well-liked, no record)
	* π did all of the salvaging in good faith, broad daylight, didn't intend to steal from the gov't

* **Procedural History**
	* Gov't indicted π saying he unlawfully stole gov't property
	* π said he thought casings were abandoned
	* Gov't said you still can't take abandoned property from land you don't own
	* Court wouldn't let π argue that he didn't intend to steal
	* Ct said he stole if he:
		1. Took the property
		2. Without permission
		3. The property was worth >$.01
	* Found guilty & ct. of app. affirmed

* **Issue**
	* Does the crime of theft require intent to steal?

* **Reasoning**
	* Intent requirement is an essential part of the tradition of criminal law.
	* Crime is a compound concept, including act & intent
	* However, some crimes are *just* prohibited acts.
	* Back in the day, when people started widely distributing goods, we wanted to be able to enforce quality standards by punishing deviations from those standards.
	* The standard for when an act alone is punishable is when it's a matter of public welfare.
		* Usually crimes of negligence
		* Injury occurs despite lack of intent
	* Penalties for these crimes are usually small
	* Cts have been interpreting statutes that don't specify intent as not req'ing it.
		* This is a mistake.
		* Shouldn't punish a bartender for selling liquor to someone he doesn't know to be an alcoholic.
	* Strict liability crimes should only be those meant to promote diligence.
	* Tradition has req'd intent for stealing.
		* That's why congress didn't explicitly include intent in the statute.
	* Lack of explicit intent req'ment in a statute doesn't automatically invoke strict liability for crimes for which common law has required intent

* **Holding**
	* Conviction overturned.

* **Rule**
	* Statutes that do not explicitly state a mens rea requirement may still have such a requirement if the crime would have such a req'ment in the common law.
	* Strict liability only applies to crimes of negligence that threaten public safety. 

## Mistake & Ignorance
* Mistake is the inverse of mens rea
* Common law separates mistakes of fact from mistakes of law.
* MPC doesn't observe a specific/general intent distinction
* MPC doesn't have a distinction b/w mistakes of fact & mistakes of law
* Case-in-chief defense -- defense that tries to establish that prosecutor hasn't met the burden of proof
* Mistake defenses are usually case-in-chief--proving that prosector didn't establish the necessary mens rea
* Sometimes mistake defenses can be affirmative if they are based on an interpretation of the law.

### Mistakes of Fact
* (Common law only)
* If ∂ is charged with a specific intent crime, if ∂ made a honest (good faith) mistake, that can negate the required mens rea. The mistake *doesn't* need to be reasonable.
* For general intent crimes, mistake has to:
	1. Negate the intent **AND**
	2. Be honest **AND**
	3. Be reasonable

#### People v. Navarro
* Superior Ct. of CA 1979, Dowds

* **Parties**
	* π: People
	* ∂: Navarro

* **Facts**
	* ∂ charged with stealing 4 wooden beams from a construction site

* **Procedural History**
	* ∂ was charged w/ grand larceny, but convicted by a jury of petty larceny
	* ∂ said jury was improperly instructed. Jury could've found that (1) the beams were abandoned or (2) they were valuable & ∂ had no right to take them
	* ∂ proposed 2 sets of jury instructions:
		1. If someone takes something he believes in good faith to be abandoned, he isn't stealing, even if it's not reasonable to believe that it's abandoned. Prosecutor has to prove ∂ didn't have that belief.
		2. If someone takes something he believes in good faith he has permission to take, he isn't stealing, even if it's not reasonable to believe he has permission. The prosecutor must prove ∂ didn't have that belief.
	* The court actually gave these instructions
		1. If someone takes something in the reasonable & good faith belief that it's abandoned, then it isn't theft
		2. If someone takes something in the reasonable & good faith belief that he has permission to take it, then it isn't theft
		3. If you have reasonable doubt that ∂ had required criminal intent, ∂ should be acquitted.

* **Issue**
	* Does a ∂'s good faith belief that the property he took was abandoned have to be reasonable?

* **Reasoning**
	* Evidence showed ∂ believed the beams were abandoned
	* So while he had the general intent to take the beams, he lacked the specific intent to deprive the beams' owner of them
	* For general intent crimes, only a reasonable mistake of facts is sufficient to negate intent.
	* There is no reasonableness requirement for specific intent crimes
	* There is no such thing as negligent larceny

* **Holding**
	* Rev'd

* **Rule**
	* For specific intent crimes, a good faith mistake need not be reasonable in order to negate the intent requirement
 
#### Bell v. State
* AK Ct of App 1983, Bryner

* **Parties**
	* π: Bell
	* ∂: State

* **Facts**
	* π was a 29-yo army sgt when he recruited two 16-yo (CR & MJ) & 1 14yo (DW) for prostitution.
	* CR lived with π & started engaging in prostitution when ∂ said he would marry her & buy her a car.
	* π assaulted MJ for drinking instead of working
	* CR & MJ became afraid & left & called police
	* Police got warrant to record conversations b/w MJ, CR & Bell

* **Procedural History**
	* 3 counts of promoting prostitutions in the 1st degree:
		1. DW, for <14yo
		2. CR, for forcing her 
		3. MJ
		4. Indictment said π had a house of prostitution
	* π was convicted of promoting prostitution in the 1st degree (counts 1 & 4)
	* Acquitted of 2
	* Not guilty of 1st deg in count 3, but convicted of 3rd degree attempted promotion of prostitution
	* Sentenced to 5 yrs (1 susp) for 1, & 4 years (3 susp.) for IV
	* π appealed conviction & sentence.
	* π said he should've been able to present a mistake of age defense in count 1.
	* π said barring mistake of age as a defense (which AK does by statute) is a 14th amendment violation

* **Issue**
	* Can a defendant use a mistake of fact defense against a charge of a general intent crime

* **Reasoning**
	* Legislature intended age to be an aggravating factor
	* π knew he was consciously doing the act that the law prohibited.
	* Jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that he made DW go into prostitution
	* That's enough for general intent crimes
	* If behavior would've been illegal even if Bell's belief were true, then he can't use his mistaken beliefs as a defense

* **Holding**
	* Aff'd

* **Rule**
	* Mistake of fact isn't a defense in cases based on general intent crimes 
 
### Mistakes of Law
* In both common law & MPC, ignorance of the law is no excuse **UNLESS**
	1. ∂ relied on an incorrect but official interpretation of the law
	2. Knowledge of the law is itself an element of the crime
	3. Not fair notice of legal duty

#### Official interpretation of the law (Entrapment by estoppel)
* In common law districts, ∂s can claim the official interpretation of the law is the cause of their criminal act.
* This is entrapment by estoppel (reliance)

#### People v. Marrero
* Ct App NY 1987, Bellacosa

* **Parties**
	* π: People
	* ∂: Marrero

* **Facts**
	* NY law allowed peace officers to carry handguns without permits
	* ∂ was a fed. corrections officer
	* ∂ was arrested for carrying a handgun without a permit
 	* ∂ said he believed he was a peace officer & was entitled to do so

* **Procedural History**
	* ∂ argued mistake of law
	* ∂ was convicted of 3rd deg criminal possession

* **Issue**
	* Is a personal misinterpretation of a stature sufficient to support a mistake of law defense? 

* **Reasoning**
	* Holmes: Allowing ignorance of the law as a defense would encourage ignorance of the law
	* ∂ claimed his mistake was based on an his interpretation of an official statement
	* Mistake of law defense was meant to apply very narrowly to official interpretations--not personal interpretations
	* Official statement of the law would have needed to actually permitted the conduct at some point and only been correctly interpreted later (MPC § 2.04, on which the NY statute was based)
	* Public policy: If we permitted individual mistaken interpretation of the law to be a defense, everyone would do it.

* **Holding**
	* Conviction affirmed

* **Rule**
	* Mistaken interpretation of a statute has to be an official one in order to support a mistake of law defense.
 
* **Dissent**
	* Hancock
	* Holding goes against the plain meaning of NY's mistake of law law.
	* **II**
		* Statue allows mistakes based on official statements of law
		* Statute's obvious meaning req's that mistakes based on official statements of law are defenses
		* Majority's understanding of the mistake of law statute (that the statute had to permit ∂'s behavior before the statute was invalidated) goes against the rule that penal statutes should favor defendants.
		* According to the majority, only a ∂ who isn't mistaken about the law can invoke a mistake of law defense.
		* That's clearly illogical.
		* Purpose of the law was a jurisprudential modernization which meant to remove the common law restriction against using mistake of law as a defense.
		* Legislators wanted there to be a mistake of law defense, but not an ignorance of law defense.
		* MPC comparison is inapt. MPC says what the majority said, but the NY statute goes against that, and was intended to allow mistake of law defense.
		* The "afterward determined" clause in the MPC *isn't in* the NY statute

#### Cheek v. United States
* SCOTUS 1991, White

* **Parties**
	* π: Cheek, conscientious objector to the income tax system
	* ∂: US

* **Facts**
	* Tax law only criminalizes "willful" tax evasion.
	* Cheek didn't pay income tax in 1980, 81, or 83-86.
	* Was told by attorneys that federal tax laws were invalid & 16th amendment didn't authorize a tax on wages.

* **Procedural History**
	* Jury instructions:
		1. For willfulness, gov't had to prove intentional violation of a known legal duty--not mistake, ignorance, or negligence.
		2. Objectively reasonable, good-faith misunderstanding of the law would negate willfulness
		3. Cheek is not guilty if jury believes he honestly & reasonably believed that he didn't have to pay income tax. 
		4. An opinion that tax law is unconstitutional doesn't count as a good faith misunderstanding. 
	* After all of that, with the jury still deadlocked, they got another instruction from the judge:
		5. An honest but unreasonable belief does not negate willfulness
	* Jury found Cheek guilty on all counts.
	* Cheek appealed objecting to (5).

* **Issue**
	* Is an unreasonable good-faith misunderstanding sufficient to negate mens rea?

* **Reasoning**
	* Ignorance or mistake of the law is generally no defense.
	* Tax law is huge & complicated, so Congress added mens rea req'ments to the criminal parts of tax law so that nobody would be a criminal just for failing to pay taxes (specific intent)(*US v. Murdock*).
	* Murdock ct. said proper standard to tell the jury is whether ∂ acted in good faith based on his actual belief.
	* *Bishop* & *Pomponio* together make the standard that willfulness is the voluntary intentional violation of a known legal duty.
	* **III**
		* **A**
			* In a case where a ∂ knew of a statute and believed the statute was valid, gov't just has prove actual knowledge of the duty in order to establish willfulness
			* If jury believed Cheek really didn't believe he had a legal duty to pay income tax, the gov'ts case wouldn't be enough to prove willfulness.
			* Saying a belief isn't reasonable takes this case from being a question of fact to being a question of law, and out of the jury's hands.
		* **B**
			* Cheek said his good faith belief that income tax is unconstitutional and therefore he couldn't have known he had a duty
			* That dog won't hunt.
			* Such beliefs aren't innocent mistakes.
			* He was free to to pay the taxes and then ask for a refund on the grounds that the taxes were invalid.
			* Belief in the validity of the tax system is irrelevant to the willfulness question so the court was right to tell the jury to disregard that belief. (4) is okay.
			
* **Holding**
	* An honest but unreasonable mistake negates mens rea
	* But the belief that the tax code is unconstitutional is not that. The belief is based on study & understanding of the law.

* **Rule**
	* The standard for statutory willfulness is the voluntary intentional violation of a known legal duty => implies bad faith
 
* **Concurrence**
	* Scalia.
	* If "willful" means "evil," that doesn't match up with the thought process of someone who doesn't pay taxes because he doesn't believe the law requires him to.
	* An honest but wrong belief about the unconstitutionality of a law should negate the mens rea of violating that law.
	* If you have an honest belief that a law is unconstitutional, how is that constitute knowledge of a duty?
	
#### Bryan v. United States
* SCOTUS 1998, Stevens

* **Parties**
	* π: Bryan
	* ∂: United States

* **Facts**
	* Omnibus crime bill made it illegal to deal firearms without a license.
	* Lack of any intent req'ment essentially made selling guns a strict liability crime.
	* Congress later amended the law to req that a defendant acted "willfully"
	* π didn't have a license to sell guns
	* π bought guns from straw purchasers to whom he gave assurances that he world file the serial nos off of the guns.
	* He knew he was doing illegal things, but there's no evidence that he knew he was violating the particular law of which he was convicted.

* **Procedural History**
	* At trial, π asked that jury be told that he needed to know of the licensing req'ment in order to be convicted.
	* Judge denied, instructing instead that: willfully means acting intentionally with the purpose of doing something the law forbids, even if he doesn't know the specific law he is breaking.
	* π was convicted of dealing firearms w/o a license
	* Ct. of app. affirmed.

* **Issue**
	* Does a statutory requirement of willfulness require just that he knew his act was illegal or did he have to know about the licensing requirement?

* **Reasoning**
* Willful req's bad purpose. Gov't has to prove conduct was knowingly unlawful.
		* π argues that since congress said "knowingly" in three other places & "willfully" here, they meant to set a higher standard.
			* This is irrelevant b/c "knowingly" is not a mental state req'ment.
		* "factual knowledge" is different from "knowledge of the law"
		* *Staples*: If you know you have a machine gun with the characteristics that violate the law, you don't have to know the law itself. Knowing the facts that constitute the offense is sufficient.
		* π argues that since 'willfully' in tax law req's knowledge of the specific law, it should here, too
			* but those laws were designed to protect people from violating those laws accidentally. *they are an exception*

* **Holding**
	* Aff'd

* **Rule**
	* ∂ doesn't have to know the specific statute he is violating in order to "willfully" violate it
 
* **Dissent**
	* Scalia
	* Statute is genuinely ambiguous on the issue.
	* Rule of lenity should apply.
	
#### Lambert v. California
* SCOTUS 1957, Douglas

* **Parties**
	* π: CA
	* ∂: Lambert

* **Facts**
	* LA Municipal Code defs a "convicted person" as anyone convicted of a crime in CA or convicted of something elsewhere that would also be a crime in CA.
	* LA Code also says it's illegal for a "convicted person" to be in LA for more than 5 days without registering
	* ∂ was arrested for something else & then charged with violating the reg. law.
	* She had been convicted of forgery 7 yrs prior but never registered.

* **Procedural History**
	* Convicted at trial by jury
	* Appealed saying LA law is unconstitutional.

* **Issue**
	* Can a registration law apply to someone who does not know of the law?

* **Reasoning**
	* No willfulness req'ment in LA Muni. Code.
	* Assume she didn't know the law.
	* Conduct alone is often enough for violation, but in such cases the conduct is usually commission rather than omission.
	* Notice is essential to due process in cases where penalty may be incurred due to failure to act.
	* Statute is just an easy way for law enforcement to get a list of names & addresses of convicted people.
	* When she was told of the law & her violation of it, she didn't get a chance to bring herself into compliance.
	* Actual knowledge of the law is necessary to establish duty

* **Holding**
	* Rev'd. LA reg law violates 14th amendment due process

* **Rule**
	* Can't punish conduct when offender doesn't know the law prohibiting that conduct and there's no reason she should know.
 
* **Dissent**
	* There are plenty of laws that you can break without knowing they exist.

#### State v. Bryant
* Supreme Ct. of NC 2005, Brady

* **Parties**
	* π: NC
	* ∂: Bryant

* **Facts**
	* When ∂ was in jail in SC he was told that he needed to put himself on the SC sex offender registry when he got out.
	* Statute says that when offender leaves SC, he has to notify the state w/in 10 days.
	* ∂ reregistered in 8/2000 saying he moved to Pickens County, SC.
	* ∂ was in W-S, NC working the Dixie Classic Fair in 10/2000
	* While he was there he met a woman.
	* He moved in with her in 11/2000 & proposed to her in 12/2000.
	* He lived & got mail at her address.
	* ∂ stayed there until 3/2001 when they broke up.
	* ∂ didn't dispute his NC residence, but never reg'd with SC after moving.
	* ∂ acknowledged to police that he didn't register with SC & also that was convicted as a sex offender in FL, too.
	* NC also had a law like SC's req'ing sex offenders to register.

* **Procedural History**
	* ∂ was convicted of failing to register & became a habitual felon.
	* ∂ appealed saying NC registry law was unconstitutional as applied to an out-of-stater.

* **Issue**
	* Can a registration law apply to someone who hasn't received actual notice of the law?

* **Reasoning**
	* There had been registry req'ments in all 50 states & DC for 6 years before ∂'s arrest in NC.
	* Program is meant to help NC police & sex offenders have a high recidivism rate
	* State has a strong safety interest in keeping tabs on sex offenders.
	* NC law requires new residents who are sex offender to register within 10 days
	* Legislature removed the mens rea req'ment from the statute in 1997. Strict liability offense.
	* Not every crime needs an intent req'ment to satisfy due process. The clear legislative intent here plugs the due process hole.
	* Substantive vs. procedural due process.
	* ∂ is relying on PDP here saying he didn't have notice.
	* ∂ says state has to prove actual notice of the registration requirement in order to satisfy PDP & SC statutes didn't say anything about registering outside of SC.
	* Difference between this case & *Lambert* is that in *Lambert* she had no reason to think she should ask if she needed to register.
	* That was a municipal ordinance, contrasted with an statewide state law in NC
	* NC law narrowly targets sex offenders
	* NC registry isn't just an administrative convenience--it's a public safety effort
	* ∂ knew of his lifelong duty to reg in SC & he himself volunteered the info about his FL conviction.
	* Sex offender reg's are pervasive.
	* Not asking about local reg laws is neither innocent nor wholly passive.

* **Holding**
	* 

* **Rule**
	* Sex offender registration laws can apply to someone who hasn't received actual notice of the law.

## Causation and Concurrence
* Causation is part of the actus reus requirement. The actus reus is (1) a voluntary act or omission (2) that *causes* (3) social harm.
* Criminal causation is stricter than tort causation.
* Two kinds of causation, both of which need to apply for criminal responsibility

### Actual ("but for") causation
* ∂ has to be the actual cause (or at least one cause among many) of the social harm
* "but for" test: "but for ∂'s act or omission, would the harm have occurred when it did?"

### Proximate causation
* ∂'s act or omission has to be the (or a) nonintermediated cause of the harm **OR**
	* if there are intervening causes, they must be dependent ("responsive") on ∂'s act or omission.
* Independent intervening causes usually negate criminal liability.

#### Commonwealth v. Rementer
* Superior ct of PA 1991, Beck

* **Parties**
	* π: PA
	* ∂: Rementer

* **Facts**
	* Mary Berry was killed by a car while trying to escape continued assault by ∂
	* ∂ & Berry were in a bar together.
	* Bartender saw them arguing.
	* Berry was upset & crying hysterically.
 	* Berry got into her cab, π pushed her out of the driver's seat & drove away.
	* Witness saw Berry hanging out of the window calling for help saying ∂ was going to kill her.
	* ∂ was beating her & pulling her hair
	* Berry fell out of the window.
	* ∂ got out of the car & kept beating her.
	* More witnesses saw Berry escape & be beaten & recaptured until one witness saw ∂ punch Berry in the head & then run into traffic.
	* That witness saw her grab the window of a station wagon then fall under its wheels (2min after ∂ punched her in the head)
	* Station wagon driver had his family in the car & they were scared of Berry screaming & trying to get into the car
	* Driver pushed Berry away & sped off. He didn't know he had run her over until he saw it on the news days later.
	* Coroner found blunt trauma to the head (from the beating) & that the cause of death was the crush injury to the chest caused by the car
	* ∂ said he & Berry had injected cocaine & were drinking & that he drove her cab out of concern for her due to her "schizy" behavior.
	* Claimed he only hit her once & didn't intend to kill her.

* **Procedural History**
	* ∂ was convicted of 3rd deg murder in a bench trial
	* ∂ appealed saying π didn't prove he caused the death or prove malice (an element of murder-3)	
	* ∂ said the argument was over by the time Berry got to the car so the car was an intervening cause. Chain of causation was broken.
	* ∂ said her death was not foreseeable.

* **Issue**
	* Can ∂ be convicted of murder that he did not directly cause?

* **Reasoning**
	* Stricter standard for criminal causation than for tort causation.
	* Causation must be direct and substantial.
	* Has to be determined case by case
	* Standard: was ∂'s conduct so directly and substantially linked to the harm that it would be *fair* to hold ∂ criminally liable?
	* Immediate cause was not the assault.
	* Two part test:
		1. "but for" analysis
			* Conduct was a direct & substantial cause, even though there were other causal factors
			* If i do something that causes you to have to be on life support & you are disoriented & interfere with your life support & die as a result, i am still responsible
		2. was the causal connection close enough to fairly impose criminal liability?
			* Result has to be "foreseeable" in light of ∂'s conduct
	* Witnesses saw ∂ & Berry fighting right up until Berry ran into traffic, & the station wagon family saw ∂ chase Berry
	* Death in the way Berry died is a foreseeable consequence of assault in & around a public street

* **Holding**
	* Aff'd

* **Rule**
	* Two part test for whether an intermediate cause is "proximate" for the purposes of establishing criminal liability
		1. "but for" analysis
			* Conduct was a direct & substantial cause, even though there were other causal factors
		2. was the causal connection close enough to fairly impose criminal liability?
			* Result has to be "foreseeable" in light of ∂'s conduct

#### State v. Govan
* AZ ct of app, 1987

* **Parties**
	* π: AZ
	* ∂: Govan

* **Facts**
	* ∂ lived with Keeble for 3 years.
	* ∂ & Keeble were arguing over ∂'s alleged molestation of K's teenage daughter
	* K shot at ∂.
	* ∂ ran away, but came back later & was seen arguing with K.
	* K tried to call the police on a neighbor's phone but ∂ pulled out a gun & shot K in the neck while she was dialing.
	* K became paralyzed from the neck down.
	* ∂ said he didn't intend to shoot, but that he drew the gun & fired behind him without aiming.
	* ∂ was charged with aggravated assault.
	* ∂ & K got married while K was in the hospital.
	* Assault charges were dismissed without prejudice.
	* She got pneumonia & died.

* **Procedural History**
	* ∂ charged with murder-2 & convicted by a jury of manslaughter

* **Issue**
	* Can ∂ be criminally responsible for causally distant harms, such as illness or hospital complications due to ∂'s conduct?

* **Reasoning**
	* ∂ argued the shot wasn't necessarily the cause of the quadriplegia.
	* Drs said gunshot caused quadriplegia which caused pneumonia which caused death
	* Gunshot was *substantial* cause of quadriplegia.
	* Any link in that causal chain would be insufficient if it were not a foreseeable consequence but each was, so ∂'s conduct was a proximate cause of K's death.
	* ∂ argued K didn't seek medical attention for two weeks after knowing she was sick & had lost the will to live, which broke the causal chain going back to the gunshot.
	* Had K voluntarily harmed herself, this would've broken the chain.
	* As it was, she just failed to act. The pain & sickness that caused K to no longer want to live were still all caused by ∂'s conduct.

* **Holding**
	* Aff'd

* **Rule**
	* ∂ can be criminally responsible for causally distant harms as long as they are foreseeable consequences of ∂'s actions.

### Concurrence
* The mens rea must occur at the same time as the actus reus **AND**
* The mens rea must cause the actus reus

#### Thabo Meli v. Reginam
* Privy Council 1954

* **Parties**
	* π: Reginam
	* ∂: Thabo Meli

* **Facts**
	* ∂s plotted to bring v to a hut and kill him.
	* ∂s took v to hut, gave him a beer  & hit him on the head.
	* ∂s thought v was dead, but he probably wasn't
	* ∂s took v from the hut & rolled him off a small cliff intending it to look like an accident.
	* v died at the bottom of the cliff of exposure.

* **Procedural History**
	* 4 ∂s convicted of murder

* **Issue**
	* Can concurrence requirement be satisfied when cause of death is not concurrent with mens rea?
	
* **Reasoning**
	* The cause of death (exposure) was not concurrent with the mens rea.
	* Just because ∂s were wrong about v being dead when they rolled him off the cliff, they intended to kill him and they did.

* **Holding**
	* Conviction affirmed

* **Rule**
	* Concurrence requirement can be satisfied even when the actual cause of death is not concurrent with the mens rea as long as intent to kill is concurrent with the first step in the causal chain that brought about death.
