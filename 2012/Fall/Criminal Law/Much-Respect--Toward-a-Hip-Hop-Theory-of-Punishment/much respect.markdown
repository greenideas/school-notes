# Much Respect: Toward a Hip-Hop Theory of Punishment -- Paul Butler

* Hip-hop can be used to create a system of punishment that:
	1. is coherent
	2. enhances public safety
	3. is respectful of offenders

## Characteristics of hip-hop culture
* Retributive.
* Acknowledges that having too many people are away from home due to incarceration will have unintended consequences
* Art form is dominated by the same racial/ethnic groups that make up most of the prison population
* Political

## Hip-hop and social norms
* In hip-hop culture, prison itself is used to indict the government since it's believed that prison is used to keep minorities in line.
* Breaking the law is rebelling against status quo
* Since hip-hop artists are tastemakers, their take on punishment may be a bellwether for the rest of society's destigmatization of it.
* When prison is seen as inevitable, capricious, and even a rite of passage, it may no longer deter.

## Punishment
* Core principles:
	1. People who harm should themselves be harmed.
	2. Criminals are human beings, deserving of respect.
	3. Communities can be destroyed by punishment as well as crime.
	
* A Rawlsian take might be that since minority communities get the worst of our system of punishment, they are in the best position to design a fair system (for individuals).

### Why punish?
#### Retribution and respect
* Respect is a cardinal virtue in hip-hop
* Retributivists think punishment is a form of respect since it acknowledges the moral agency of the criminal.
* Harsh sentences for drug offenses are justified on utilitarian, not retributivist, grounds.
* Hip-hop emphasizes the role of environment in shaping behavior

#### Hip-hop utility
* Even when punishment is deserved, it may have sweeping unintended consequences for the community.
* Classic retributivists believe that considering social costs of punishment is immoral
* Hip-hop believes that one must consider social costs
* Maybe allow prisoners to work to support their families, or family leave could be allowed

### What to punish
#### Who's bad
* Morality is not distributed across racial lines in the same proportion as the racial composition of the prison population
* The villains of hip-hop are the purveyors of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms who are themselves politically powerful

#### Hip-hop & drugs
* Smoking marijuana is both recreational and political. Part of the hip-hop identity.

### How to punish
#### Punishment from inside
* Hip-hop culture is wary of how law enforcement scrutinizes minority communities
* The communities from which offenders come should be able to participate more in punishment. 
* More minorities on juries & sentencing panels.
* Offenders could be punished by fellow community members

#### Prison
* Hip-hop & Kant agree that it is immoral to punish people in order to benefit society.
