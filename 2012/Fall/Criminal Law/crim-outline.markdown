# Criminal Law Outline
## Punishment
### Justifications
* **Consequentialist** - actions are morally right if they have desirable outcomes
* **Nonconsequentialist** - actions are intrinsically morally right or wrong
	* *Retributivism* is a nonconsequentialist theory of punishment that makes the amount of punishment proportional to the amount of harm caused.

### 5 Theories of Punishment
1. General deterrence
2. Specific deterrence
3. Rehabilitation
4. Incapacitation
5. Retribution

### Relevant Cases
#### Regina v. Dudley & Stephens
* What should be the takeaway?

* Penological objectives must be considered & balanced while making sentencing decisions.

### Constitutional Limits on the Power to Punish
* The judiciary protects the minority from the majority

#### 14th Amendment Due Process: Void for Vagueness
* A statute is void for vagueness iff:
	1. There is insufficient notice, **or**
	2. Insufficient guidelines for application--too much discretion

#### 8th amendment prohibition on cruel & unusual punishment
* Punishment is prohibited under the 8th amendment ban on cruel & unusual punishment if:
	* Punishment is disproportionate to the harm caused
		* *narrow proportionality* - punishment has to be grossly disproportionate in order to run afoul of the 8th amendment
	* **OR** 	punishment is categorically excluded
		* DP based on characteristics of offense (Robbery? No. Adult rape? No. Child rape? No.)
		* DP based on characteristics of the offender

#### Equal protection
