Here's an interesting article about how courts in Florida are reacting to the decisions is Graham and Miller: http://www2.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/2012/sep/02/2/courts-grappling-with-juveniles-life-sentences-ar-481011/ (found via the excellent Sentencing Law and Policy blog: http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2012/09/interesting-report-on-how-florida-prosecutor-approaches-graham-and-miller.html).

There's one comment in the TBO article from a prosecutor that I found a little confusing. He's quoted in this snippet:

Because of that, he said, the Miller decision means juvenile killers convicted of second-degree murder will be entitled to new sentencing hearings "unless by some bizarre chance, the judge, at the time of sentencing, actually considered the status of the juvenile's development and how they would continue to develop in the future and all the issues that the Supreme Court says you have to take into consideration -- the maturity of the child basically.

As I understood it, according to Kennedy's opinion in Graham, it doesn't matter if the judge considers maturity at the time of sentencing, since we can't know how juveniles will end up maturing until they have a chance to, you know, mature. To wit, Kennedy says:

even if we were to assume that some juvenile nonhomicide offenders might have “sufficient psychological maturity, and at the same time demonstrat[e] sufficient depravity,” Roper , 543 U. S., at 572, to merit a life without parole sentence, it does not follow that courts taking a case-by-case proportionality approach could with sufficient accuracy distinguish the few incorrigible juvenile offenders from the many that have the capacity for change.

So a judge can consider maturity all she wants, but she still can't sentence a juvenile to life without parole for a nonhomicide crime (just in the context of Graham), right? What am I missing?
