# Criminal Law Class Notes

## August 28
### What is criminal law?
* Not criminal procedure
* Not criminal justice (policing strategies, running correctional facilities)

### Regina v. Dudley and Stephens
* Reckless yacht owner - The boat was defective and the owner knew.
* 25 days between wreck and rescue.
* 7 days without food (after the turtle)
* no precedent.
* Usually no duties without a special relationship (e.g. captain to crew, crew to passengers)
* D & S were not serving their country--rather they were serving the greater good of the boat.
* Situational factors are so strong that anyone would be very tempted to do the same thing.
* Situational argument rejected because there is no moral duty to preserve one's own life.

### Practice Tips
* Defense: Think about who you are representing
* Use passive voice to weaken the emotional charge
* Prosecution: Do the opposite. Make it active. Ratchet up the emotion.

## August 29
### Regina v. Dudley and Stephens (cont'd)
* Law & morality are distinct but related
* Should law aspire to the standard of morality?
	* Pros
		* Morality puts people on equal ground
	* Cons
		* Not an accurate description of how people behave
* Can there be law without government?
	* When someone is between territories, they are responsible to the laws of the territory of which they are a citizen.
* Consent to be harmed is insufficient to waive criminal liability since in criminal proceedings, the harmed party is the state.
* Brooks probably couldn't be charged with murder or conspiracy
* Should know, given a charge & a sentence, how the theories of punishment would apply in that sentence

## August 31
### People v. Suitte
* There's an expectation of safety in the home
* ~95% of criminal trials are resolved through plea bargains
* Role of judiciary vs legislature: judiciary interprets the law & applies sentence
* Trial courts have full first-hand knowledge of cases, appellate courts review proper application of discretion.
* Appellate courts can smooth over discrepancies in sentencing.
* Not a great case. Shouldn't have looked at the gov's signing statement.

## September 4
* Constitutional limitations of punishment
	* Due Process limitations
	* Limitations under cruel & unusual punishment
	* Equal protection limitations
* Due process is contained in the 14th as well as the 5th Amendment
* Papachristou relies on the 5th Amendment
* 14th Amendment, not part of the original Bill of Rights, was enacted to remedy racial disparities after the abolition of slavery.

### Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville
* Cases may be consolidated at the trial level, but it usually happens at the level of appeal or SCOTUS.
* "Reasonable suspicion" is sufficient to stop someone, and reasonable suspicion that someone is armed is sufficient to pat them down
* A full search requires probable cause.
* Main principle the court relies on in overturning these convictions is the lack of clear notice of what conduct is permitted/prohibited.
* "Notice" is important because it 1) lets people know what they can and cannot do. and 2) is what constrains discretion in enforcement.
* Rule of Lenity: When courts are unsure about whether a statute prohibits the behavior at issue, defendant gets the benefit of the doubt.
* Legality - Rule of law requires that no one can be punished for conduct unless that conduct was defined as criminal before it was committed.
* Whose discretion are we concerned with?
	* Police - Who is arrested?
	* Prosecutors - What do we charge the defendants with?
	* Judges/Juries
* If the underlying statute is hopelessly broad, no amount of regulation can save it.

## September 5
### Kolender v. Lawson
* Statute attempts to be clearer then the vagrancy statute in Papachristou--it defines loitering
* A statute is void for vagueness iff:
	1. There is insufficient notice, **or**
	2. Insufficient guidelines for application--too much discretion
* ยง 647(e) is v4v because it doesn't provide sufficient guidance for law enforcement
* Reasonable suspicion is sufficient for the stop (*Terry*), but to ask for ID, you need PC.
* Attempts to remedy v4v often create other constitutional problems (AZ immigration law)

### City of Chicago v. Morales
* Gang Congregation Ordinance shows that Chicago put a lot of effort into trying to make the statute somewhat narrow (contrast *Papachristou*)
* Consolidated appeal of 70 cases
* 42000 arrests and 89000 orders to disperse.
* Stevens's opinion is only joined in part by Souter & Ginsburg
* Substantive due process right to loiter for innocent purposes--right to remain in place. Rights are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.
* Court: Either loitering is the conduct that is prohibited & there is a notice problem or loitering isn't a problem, and then the order to disperse is unlawful.
* Too much discretion for law enforcement in discerning "apparent reason" & you can't know if there's apparent reason if you don't ask.

## September 7
* Due process limitations are about v4v. Assume everyone has read the law. Then you need to meet the requirements of sufficient notice & limiting discretion in enforcement.

### 8th amendment basics
* Modes of punishment - no torture, no drawing & quartering
	* Scalia & Thomas think this is the *only* thing covered by 8th amendment
* Proportionality - 
	* Kennedy, Roberts - *narrow proportionality* - only "grossly disproportionate" sentences are prohibited
* Evolving v. Static - Cruel & unusual is a standard, but the behavior that meets that standard changes along with public morality.
* Death is different - death is categorically different from any other kind of punishment
* Varieties of 8th amendment remedies
	* Term of years cases
	* Categorical exclusions
		* DP based on characteristics of offense (Robbery? No. Adult rape? No. Child rape? No.)
		* DP based on characteristics of the offender

### Kennedy v. Louisiana
* *Furman v. Georgia* (1972) strikes down DP. Reinstates in 1976.
* DP has to be assigned in an individual determination, so it can only be applied to the worst of the worst
* LA Stat. Ann. 14:42
* Basic aggravated rape statute
* Has to be some aggravating factor in order to be eligible for DP.

## September 11
* One-way ratchet argument - Judicial decisions that restricting DP create uncertainty about whether new laws will be struck down which creates a disincentive to creating new DP laws, and the court then takes the lack of new DP laws as evidence of consensus against DP.
* Juve transfer - A defendant in the age range where there's discretion for whether to try as an adult is put into the adult judicial system.
* *Miller* doesn't care very much about the number of jurisdictions that offer a particular sentence.

## September 12
* Biggest problem with *McKlesky* is the lack of a limiting principle.
* Statistics can be used as eviidence in:
	* Jury Venire cases - if the composition of a jury doesn't match the local demography
	* Title VII Civil Rights Claims
	* Why not capital sentencing?
		* By this point, jury is legitimately composed
		* Way too many variables go into jurors' reasoning in determining guilt and sentencing.
		* Too many actors, too many factors. It's way simpler in Title VII or Venire cases.
		* State can't practically defend against statistical arguments.
	* 8th amendment argument
		* If the race of the victim is a factor in the application of the DP, then we're not getting "the worst of the worst"
		* Rejoinder to argument that discrimination has to be shown in the particular case is that, while that might be a good argument that sentence is valid under the 14th, it's still not okay under the 8th.
	* Missing response to the "tell it to the legislature" argument: It's the job of the judiciary to protect the minority against the majority.
	* Scalia's memo: There could never be enough empirical proof.
	* Powell: If I could change one vote, it would be this one

## September 14
### Actus Reus
* Elements of a crime: 1) Prohibited thought that leads to a 2) prohibited act that 3) causes a social harm. And 4) (1) and (2) happen concurrently and (1) causes (2).

## September 18
### Wisconsin v. Mitchell
* Hate crimes require the additional mental state of animus toward the victim on the basis of race (or religion, nationality, etc.).
* Not a thought crime, since there is real harm done.
* Add'l mental state is part of the harmful act, so it's enforceable. 
* Racial motivation is generally hard to prove.

### Martin v. State
* Unless the legislature explicitly states that an act need not be volitional to be punished, we presume that conduct must be voluntary.
* Did any actor compel โ to engage in the prohibited behavior?
	* Was that actor a government agent?
	
### State v. Decina
* Case-in-chief defense - Certain elements need to be in place for a crime to occur, and those elements were not present.
* Affirmative defense - Yes, the criminal activity occurred, but there is a reason why I did it, and (1) given those circumstances, we'd want anyone to act as I did or (2) there are extenuating, justifying circumstances.
* When there is social harm, and that harm is substantial, courts will widen the lens of what constitutes an action.
* If there's a nonvolitional act that causes harm, is there an earlier volitional act that clearly caused that nonvolitional act.

## September 19
### People v. Beardsley
* Duty + Failure to act is still insufficient to establish criminal liability. There still needs to be a prohibited mental state.
* Two types of duties:
	* Duty to act directly
	* Duty to summon assistance

### Commonwealth v. Howard
* Nothing about omissions in the PA manslaughter statute circa *Howard*
* Widening the timeframe *a la Decina*: if there's a good reason Howard didn't get her daughter out of there after any particular instance of abuse, what about over time as the pattern of abuse developed?

## September 25
### Robinson v. California
* Are passive statuses like addiction punishable under the 8th & 14th amendments
* Every occasion of drug use is voluntary, but the status of addiction itself isn't voluntary and can't be punishable.
* Even if you assume that the status can't occur without many previous acts, without evidence you can't prove that those acts occurred within the jurisdiction.
* Court sidesteps the issue of drawing a line b/w addiction & disease by making the decision turn on the acts rather than the status.
* This is the most important status case to know.

### Jones v. City of Los Angeles
* *Brown v. Plata* - Prison conditions are so bad due to overcrowding that it's cruel & unusual & so some prisoners must be released.

### Mens Rea
* Mens rea requirement, using mental states to assess culpability, is what makes criminal law different.
* General moral blameworthiness is a much wider net than mens rea.
* Specific v. general intent
	* Specific: mental state has to go beyond the act itself - i have to intend to pull the trigger with the purpose of killing you
	* General: mental state that causes the harmful act itself is sufficient
* Conduct, attendant circumstances, & result
* MPC intent (strictest to least strict)
 	1. Purposely 
	2. Knowingly
	3. Recklessly
	4. Negligently
* Purposely & negligently are grouped together, as are recklessly & negligently
* Criminal negligence requires a gross deviation from reasonable care, whereas tortious negligence requires only an ordinary deviation from reasonable care.
* Purposely applies to every element of the crime, unless specified otherwise in the statute
* Willfully == "super-purposely"

## September 26
* LH p. 987 - MPC definitions of kinds of intent
* Recklessness requires that โ subjectively appreciated an unjustifiable risk but acted anyway
* Negligence doesn't require that โ appreciated the risk--just that โ's action was a gross deviation from a reasonable standard of care.
* Narrowing of the mens rea requirement protects against wrongful conviction.

### US v. Yermian
* The jurisdictional question is a circumstantial one (as opposed to a conduct or intent question).

### Model Penal Code
* ยง 2.02 (3) -- *Culpability required unless otherwise provided*
	* Unless the mens rea requirement requirement for a particular element of a crime is explicitly given by statute, then the standard is either "purposely," "knowingly," or "recklessly."
* ยง 2.02 (4) -- *Prescribed culpability requirement applies to all material elements*
	* If a mens rea requirement is specified and isn't targeted at one particular element of the crime, it applies to all of the elements.
* ยง 1.13 (10)
	* Jurisdiction is *not* a material element of a crime. Neither is statute of limitations , venue, or anything else that isn't (1) the specific harm prohibited by the law, or (2) any exculpatory circumstances written into the law.
