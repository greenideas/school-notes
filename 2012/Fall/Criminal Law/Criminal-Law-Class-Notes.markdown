# Criminal Law Class Notes

## August 28
### What is criminal law?
* Not criminal procedure
* Not criminal justice (policing strategies, running correctional facilities)

### Regina v. Dudley and Stephens
* Reckless yacht owner - The boat was defective and the owner knew.
* 25 days between wreck and rescue.
* 7 days without food (after the turtle)
* no precedent.
* Usually no duties without a special relationship (e.g. captain to crew, crew to passengers)
* D & S were not serving their country--rather they were serving the greater good of the boat.
* Situational factors are so strong that anyone would be very tempted to do the same thing.
* Situational argument rejected because there is no moral duty to preserve one's own life.

### Practice Tips
* Defense: Think about who you are representing
* Use passive voice to weaken the emotional charge
* Prosecution: Do the opposite. Make it active. Ratchet up the emotion.

## August 29
### Regina v. Dudley and Stephens (cont'd)
* Law & morality are distinct but related
* Should law aspire to the standard of morality?
	* Pros
		* Morality puts people on equal ground
	* Cons
		* Not an accurate description of how people behave
* Can there be law without government?
	* When someone is between territories, they are responsible to the laws of the territory of which they are a citizen.
* Consent to be harmed is insufficient to waive criminal liability since in criminal proceedings, the harmed party is the state.
* Brooks probably couldn't be charged with murder or conspiracy
* Should know, given a charge & a sentence, how the theories of punishment would apply in that sentence

## August 31
### People v. Suitte
* There's an expectation of safety in the home
* ~95% of criminal trials are resolved through plea bargains
* Role of judiciary vs legislature: judiciary interprets the law & applies sentence
* Trial courts have full first-hand knowledge of cases, appellate courts review proper application of discretion.
* Appellate courts can smooth over discrepancies in sentencing.
* Not a great case. Shouldn't have looked at the gov's signing statement.

## September 4
* Constitutional limitations of punishment
	* Due Process limitations
	* Limitations under cruel & unusual punishment
	* Equal protection limitations
* Due process is contained in the 14th as well as the 5th Amendment
* Papachristou relies on the 5th Amendment
* 14th Amendment, not part of the original Bill of Rights, was enacted to remedy racial disparities after the abolition of slavery.

### Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville
* Cases may be consolidated at the trial level, but it usually happens at the level of appeal or SCOTUS.
* "Reasonable suspicion" is sufficient to stop someone, and reasonable suspicion that someone is armed is sufficient to pat them down
* A full search requires probable cause.
* Main principle the court relies on in overturning these convictions is the lack of clear notice of what conduct is permitted/prohibited.
* "Notice" is important because it 1) lets people know what they can and cannot do. and 2) is what constrains discretion in enforcement.
* Rule of Lenity: When courts are unsure about whether a statute prohibits the behavior at issue, defendant gets the benefit of the doubt.
* Legality - Rule of law requires that no one can be punished for conduct unless that conduct was defined as criminal before it was committed.
* Whose discretion are we concerned with?
	* Police - Who is arrested?
	* Prosecutors - What do we charge the defendants with?
	* Judges/Juries
* If the underlying statute is hopelessly broad, no amount of regulation can save it.

## September 5
### Kolender v. Lawson
* Statute attempts to be clearer then the vagrancy statute in Papachristou--it defines loitering
* A statute is void for vagueness iff:
	1. There is insufficient notice, **or**
	2. Insufficient guidelines for application--too much discretion
* ยง 647(e) is v4v because it doesn't provide sufficient guidance for law enforcement
* Reasonable suspicion is sufficient for the stop (*Terry*), but to ask for ID, you need PC.
* Attempts to remedy v4v often create other constitutional problems (AZ immigration law)

### City of Chicago v. Morales
* Gang Congregation Ordinance shows that Chicago put a lot of effort into trying to make the statute somewhat narrow (contrast *Papachristou*)
* Consolidated appeal of 70 cases
* 42000 arrests and 89000 orders to disperse.
* Stevens's opinion is only joined in part by Souter & Ginsburg
* Substantive due process right to loiter for innocent purposes--right to remain in place. Rights are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.
* Court: Either loitering is the conduct that is prohibited & there is a notice problem or loitering isn't a problem, and then the order to disperse is unlawful.
* Too much discretion for law enforcement in discerning "apparent reason" & you can't know if there's apparent reason if you don't ask.
