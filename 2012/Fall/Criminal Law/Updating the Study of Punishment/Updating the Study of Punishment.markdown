## Updating the Study of Punishment
### Punishment & Social Science
* Traditional view of punishment is that attaching high penalties to crimes in order to deter further offenses.
* Cost of the activity is balanced against cost of enforcement

#### Substitution Effects
* Becker - Punishment for a crime is the "price" paid. Punishment should make the cost of the crime exceed the benefit to the criminal.
* Marginal deterrence - Penalties should keep criminals from committing the same crime on a greater scale. Instead of asking whether punishment for X deters X, does it deter the marginally more serious X+1
* Substitution effects make us ask if we deter one crime are we just encouraging a substitute crime.
* Because of the punishment-dosage ratio, the savvy criminal will sell heroin instead of crack, since you can carry a lot more heroin than crack for the same sentence.
* Excessively high punishments lower the marginal cost of other crimes. ("What are you going to do, kill me twice?")

#### Decision Framing
* If X has a high penalty, it might encourage more people to commit Y and Z, that may have smaller penalties. If Y and/or Z is more dangerous, this is obviously not a good result.

#### Educational Impact
* Even if criminals don't have explicit knowledge of sentences, messages are conveyed--sentences help establish norms.
* But then if you take the criminal out of society, the norms no longer influence them.

#### Inverse Sentencing Effect
* Higher penalties may make people less likely to enforce the law or to impose those penalties in trial.
* Bad check enforcement went up in CO when the penalties were lowered. Fewer bad checks were written.

#### Social Control
* Strong communities may deter crime.
* Incarceration may disrupt family structures and thus lead to more offending down the road.

#### Punishment Practice & Legitimacy
* Social psych says people obey the law for normative reasons--they see it as just
* If this is the case, it benefits everyone to have laws that are perceived as fair
