# Battery
1. An **act** such that:
	* **Requires volition**: voluntary contraction of muscles
	* Involuntary movements are insufficient
	* Mental illness or immaturity does not automatically remove liability 
* **AND** that contact is **intentional** (*Van Camp v. McAfoos*)
	* **Knowledge:** Intent requires that the actor knows his actions will bring about contact (*Garratt v. Dailey*)
			* **Policy justification**: protecting personal integrity is an important basis for battery
			* Good motive is not a defense. (*Cohen v. Smith*)
			* If D **reasonably believed** consent was given, there is no knowledge (*Mullins v. Parkview Hospital*)
	* **Substantially Certain:** Intent is sufficient if D knows the act is substantially certain to produce harmful contact
		* Have to ask what the defendant knew (*Garrat v. Dailey* -- what did little Brian know?) 
		* In some states, it is sufficient that the actor knowingly brings about contact and that the contact is harmful (e.g. Utah, *Wagner v. State*)
		* Other states require **dual-intent**. That is, intent to make contact **and** intent to harm (CO, *White v. Muniz*)
		* If an actor has both intent to make contact and intent to make harm, but through accident or mistake makes harmful contact with someone other than his intended target, intent is transferred to the actual victim (*Stoshak v. East Baton Rouge Parish School*) regardless of whether he knew the victim was nearby. (*Baska v. Scherzer*)
* **AND** 
	* **harmful contact** with another person results
		* **Contact:** D doesn't need to make direct physical contact with P's body if D's act invades P's body space (French ambassador's cane)
	* **Offensive contact** - if contact doesn't harm, it may be offensive to victim's "reasonable sense of personal dignity" (*Snyder v. Turk*)
		* Offense may occur even if contact would not be offensive to most people (*Cohen v. Smith*)
		* **Policy justification:** person has a right to control her/his own body
