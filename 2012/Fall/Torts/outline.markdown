## Battery
1. An **act** such that:
	* **Requires volition**: voluntary contraction of muscles
		* Involuntary movements are insufficient
		* Mental illness or immaturity does not automatically remove liability 
	* **AND** that contact is **intentional** (*Van Camp v. McAfoos*)
		* **Purpose**
		* **Knowledge:** Intent requires that the actor knows his actions will bring about contact (*Garratt v. Dailey*)
			* **Policy justification**: protecting personal integrity is an important basis for battery
			* Good motive is not a defense. (*Cohen v. Smith*)
			* If D **reasonably believed** consent was given, there is no knowledge (*Mullins v. Parkview Hospital*)
		* **Substantially Certain:** Intent is sufficient if D knows the act is substantially certain to produce harmful contact
			* Have to ask what the defendant knew (*Garratt v. Dailey* -- what did little Brian know?) 
			* In some states, it is sufficient that the actor knowingly brings about contact and that the contact is harmful (e.g. Utah, *Wagner v. State*)
			* Other states require **dual-intent**. That is, intent to make contact **and** intent to harm (CO, *White v. Muniz*)
			* If an actor has both intent to make contact and intent to make harm, but through accident or mistake makes harmful contact with someone other than his intended target, intent is transferred to the actual victim (*Stoshak v. East Baton Rouge Parish School*) regardless of whether he knew the victim was nearby. (*Baska v. Scherzer*)
				* Transferred intent goes for torts other than battery, as well. If I intend assault but end up battering you, that suffices for intent.
	* **AND** 
		* **harmful contact** with another person results
			* **Contact:** D doesn't need to make direct physical contact with P's body if D's act invades P's body space (French ambassador's cane)
		* **Offensive contact** - if contact doesn't harm, it may be offensive to victim's "reasonable sense of personal dignity" (*Snyder v. Turk*)
			* Offense may occur even if contact would not be offensive to most people (*Cohen v. Smith*)
			* Offense may be committed when contact is unconsented to.
			* **Policy justification:** person has a right to control her/his own body

## Assault
* Assault is effectuated when one acts intending to cause harmful or offensive contact with the person of the other or an imminent apprehension of such contact
	* Apprehension must be one which would normally be aroused in the mind of a reasonable person.
* Battery often co-occurs with assault, but battery can occur without assault, as in the case where someone is tackled from behind, or if I punch someone in the back of the head.
* "Words alone" are insufficient, but words don't occur in a vacuum. Circumstances always come into play.

## False Imprisonment
* Conduct by an actor intended to confine, and that does confine another within boundaries fixed by the actor.
	* Physical constraint
	* **OR** the threat of force
		* Physical restraint isn't necessary as long as a reasonable person (objective test) believed they were confined.
	* **OR** the false implication of legal authority to confine
	* Extent of confinement
		* Confinement can be for any appreciable amount of time, however short
		* Confinement must be in a specific area
* **AND** P is
	* Conscious of the confinement
	* **OR** is harmed by it
* **Policy rationale** - Autonomy and freedom of movement should be respected.

## Intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED)
* New tort--not around in the middle ages
* Emotional distress damages are usually parasitic on other torts, but IIED stands on its own.
* *IIED*
	* Intentional or reckless act
	* **AND** and outrageous -- conduct beyond all bounds of normal social activity
	* **AND** severe emotional distress
* Recklessness: D knew of a risk that his behavior would bring about emotional distress and doesn't do anything to mitigate that risk 
* IIED for public figures must be a false statement of fact

* 3rd parties have an IIED cause of action if:
	* the behavior is directed at a member of P's immediate family while P is present.
	* the behavior is directed at any 3rd party if P's emotional distress results in bodily harm.

## Property Torts
### Trespass to land
* Intent (intent here contains all of the standard ways of establishing intent: purpose, knowledge, or substantially certain) to enter upon land of another
* **AND** D actually enters the land
* **OR** D causes an object to enter P's land

### Conversion of chattels
* Intent to exercise dominion over another's chattel
* **AND** substantial dominion occurs
	* D treats chattel as their own

### Trespass to chattels
* Intentional physical interference with the use and enjoyment of personal property in P's possession 
* **AND** P was harmed as a result.
	* Diminishes the physical condition, quality, or value of the chattel
	* **OR** Deprives P of use for a substantial (finite) time
* Damages are the diminished value of the chattel and/or any harm P suffered as a result.

## Affirmative Defenses to Tort Claims
### Self-defense
* Use of reasonable force to defend against harmful or offensive contact (battery) or confinement
* **AND** Amount of force used in defense must be proportional the force used in the threat.
	* Deadly force can only be used to defend against death or serious bodily harm (sexual contact counts here, too)

### Defenses to property
* Must be reasonable cause to believe there was theft.
* **AND** Actions taken towards detention must be reasonable.
* **AND** detention must be for reasonable period.

### Public Necessity
* Privilege to enter land or destroy property out of necessity if: 
	* it's for the purpose of avoiding imminent public disaster 
	* **OR** actor reasonably believes its necessary to avoid imminent public disaster

### Private Necessity
* Privilege to enter or remain on property iff: 
	1. it's necessary
	2. **OR** it appears necessary
		* for the purpose of avoiding serious harm to actor or land or chattels
		* for the purpose of avoiding serious harm to 3rd parties or their land or chattels
	3. Where the actor is responsible for actual damages to land or chattels.
