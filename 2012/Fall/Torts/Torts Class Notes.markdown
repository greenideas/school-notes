# Torts

## August 27
* Office hours after class

### Goals of Torts
* Justice (fairness)
* Deterrence
* Efficiency/Utility - The car manufacturer is a more efficient risk assesser than the driver whose brakes fail.
* Compensation
* Process/Administrability

### Bases for assigning blame
* Intent
* Reasonableness - If Ann could reasonably expect that her brakes might fail, we would be more likely to assign liability

Insurance is an alternative to the tort system

### Tort law approaches
* **Strict liability** - Everyone is liable, regardless of fault
	* Pros:
		* Very efficient
		* Maximizes compensation
	* Cons:
		* Eliminates deterrent effect
		* One size fits all--no room to assign any blame to victims
* **Intentional** - You intended to do it, you're liable (just Cain)
	* Pros:
		* Most just, since it assigns blame to all and only those who intended to do harm
* **Negligence** - If you didn't act reasonably, you're liable

### General characteristics of the tort system
* Tort law covers civil cases between parties where facts are disputed in order to assign compensation
* How much is my autonomy limited by my responsibility?

## August 28
* Settlement may be reached at any point throughout the process, and most cases do settle.

### Appeals
#### NC
* In NC, the appeals process begins in the Superior Court.
* Next up is the Court of Appeals.
* Finally to NC Supreme Court
* Superior Court > Court of Appeals > Supreme Court
#### NY
* Supreme Court > Supreme Court, Appellate Division > Court of Appeals
#### Federal
* District court > Circuit Court of Appeals > SCOTUS
### Holden v. Wal-Mart
* Award for the plaintiff was probably not sufficient to achieve deterrence.
* Facts matter. What do I know? What do I need to know that I don't know?
### Damages
* Compensatory
	* Past
		* Lost wages
		* Medical expenses
		* Pain & suffering
	* Future
		* Diminished earning capacity
		* Future medical treatment
		* Future pain & suffering
* Punitive
	* Meant to punish
* Potential for future damages must be proven.

## August 30
### Snyder v. Turk
* Liable for battery when an individual acts intending harmful **or** offensive contact **and** a harmful **or** offensive contact results.
* Contact that is offensive to a **reasonable** sense of personal dignity is sufficiently offensive to constitute battery.

### Cohen v. Smith
* Battery can occur if the defendant intentionally causes a contact that is offensive to the plaintiff even if it would not be offensive to others.
* Knowledge on the part of the defendant is extremely important to determining intent. Defendant in Cohen knew consent for contact was not given & was therefore liable. In Mullins the defendant did not know & was not liable.

### Van Camp v. McAfoos
* Facts in the record must support fault

## September 4
* Much of tort law is socially constructed.
* Battery as a tort was historically intended to discourage violence.
* Restatements -
	* Published by the American Law Institute
	* Meant to clarify the common law on a topic
	* Strongly persuasive secondary authority
	* Shows a judge how the law is being applied in other jurisdictions
* If a defendant reasonably believes plaintiff had consented to the touching there can be no liability for battery
* No intent
* Weapons, being instruments under your control, may be used in battery.

### Garratt v. Dailey
* Intent requires:
	* purpose of causing contact, **or**
	* knowledge that contact is substantially certain
* No volition, no fault.
* Subjective inquiry - determining what a party was thinking.
* Eggshell skull doctrine - If I make harmful intentional contact with your skull, and your skull caves in even if I didn't intend to harm you that much, I'm liable for the full extent of the harm.

### White v. Muniz
* Bench trial - no jury
* *Dual intent* - Defendant must not only intend contact, but also that that contact be harmful or offensive.
* It's the jury's job to determine the defendant's mental state.
* Most states have a dual intent standard.

### Wagner v. State
* *Single intent* - Defendant only needs to intend to make contact
* In the kissing hypo, the kiss is still not consented to
* Mentally ill & immature don't automatically get a free pass

## Outlining tips
* Should be concise, but have enough info to help you understand

## September 10
### Assault
#### Cullison v. Medley
* Assault is effectuated when one acts intending to cause harmful or offensive contact with the person of the other or an imminent apprehension of such contact
	* Apprehension must be one which would normally be aroused in the mind of a reasonable person.
* Battery often co-occurs with assault, but battery can occur without assault, as in the case where someone is tackled from behind, or if I punch someone in the back of the head.
* "Words alone" are insufficient, but words don't occur in a vacuum. Circumstances always come into play.

## September 11
### False Imprisonment
#### McCann v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
* Conduct by an actor intended to confine, and that does confine another within boundaries fixed by the actor.
	* Physical constraint
	* **OR** the threat of force
		* Physical restraint isn't necessary as long as a reasonable person (objective test) believed they were confined.
	* **OR** the false implication of legal authority to confine
	* Extent of confinement
		* Confinement can be for any appreciable amount of time, however short
		* Confinement must be in a specific area
* **AND** P is
	* Conscious of the confinement
	* **OR** is harmed by it
* **Policy rationale** - Autonomy and freedom of movement should be respected.

* Damages may be awarded for false imprisonment.

### Property Torts
#### Trespass to land
* Intent (intent here contains all of the standard ways of establishing intent: purpose, knowledge, or substantially certain) to enter upon land of another
* **AND** D actually enters the land
* **OR** D causes an object to enter P's land

* *Nuisance* - is an interference with the use & enjoyment of your land--BBQ was interfering with B&B's use & enjoyment even though there was no trespassing.

#### Conversion of chattels
* Intent to exercise dominion over another's chattel
* **AND** substantial dominion occurs
	* D treats chattel as their own

#### Trespass to chattels
* Intentional physical interference with the use and enjoyment of personal property in P's possession 
* **AND** P was harmed as a result.
	* Diminishes the physical condition, quality, or value of the chattel
	* **OR** Deprives P of use for a substantial (finite) time
* Damages are the diminished value of the chattel and/or any harm P suffered as a result.

## Emotional Harm
### Intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED)
* New tort--not around in the middle ages
* Emotional distress damages are usually parasitic on other torts, but IIED stands on its own.
* *IIED*
	* Intentional or reckless act
	* **AND** and outrageous -- conduct beyond all bounds of normal social activity
	* **AND** severe emotional distress
* Recklessness: D knew of a risk that his behavior would bring about emotional distress and doesn't do anything to mitigate that risk 
* IIED for public figures must be a false statement of fact

* 3rd parties have an IIED cause of action if:
	* the behavior is directed at a member of P's immediate family while P is present.
	* the behavior is directed at any 3rd party if P's emotional distress results in bodily harm.

## Defenses to Intentional Torts
* Complaint 
	* e.g.: Battery > (1) Act; (2) Intent to contact; (3) Contact results
	* π's burden
* Answer/Motion to dismiss
	* Challenge the facts. "That never happened."
	* Affirmative defenses
	* ∂'s burden.
* Privileges are codification of public policy goals.
	
### Self-defense
* Use of reasonable force to defend against harmful or offensive contact (battery) or confinement
* **AND** Amount of force used in defense must be proportional the force used in the threat.
	* Deadly force can only be used to defend against death or serious bodily harm (sexual contact counts here, too)

### Defenses to property
* Must be reasonable cause to believe there was theft.
* **AND** Actions taken towards detention must be reasonable.
* **AND** detention must be for reasonable period.
* Reasonableness standards increase flexibility & fairness.
* Tenants have the same rights of defense to property as owners.
* Warning isn't necessary when it would be required if it would be unnecessary or dangerous
* There is a privilege to threaten more force than you're actually authorized to use.

### Consent
* Consent can be revoked at any time
* Consent can't be given under duress or coercion, whether there's a disparity of power or threat of force
* Consent assumes that person giving consent knows the potential consequences of the activity being consented to.
* Consent can't be given by those who can't understand consequences & I have to know of that incapacity
* If someone consents to some activity they know might bring about harmful contact, they consent to all contact that may occur within the rules of that activity.
* Giving medical care without consent in an emergency is generally okay
* Consent relates specifically to the nature of the contact
	* If pt consents to having her tooth pulled & dentist puts her out and then commits sexual battery, that's not okay
	* If pt consents to having her tooth pulled at 11 & dentist doesn't pull it until 11:15, that's okay
* States vary on whether a cause of action can arise out of illegal activities
* Restatement rejects any blanket rejection of consent in illegal activity

### Necessity
#### Surocco v. Geary
* Natural law - baseline principles of how humans should interact with each other that aren't codified
* The potential benefit to society outweighed the cost to the Suroccos.
* One can destroy property if a reasonable person would think that doing so is necessary and in the public interest.

#### Wegner v. Milwaukee Mutual Ins. Co.
* Judgment of fairness is part of distinguishing *Wegner* from *Surocco*
* ∂ here was essentially the city of Milwaukee, whereas in *Surocco*, it was just the Alcalde of SF.
* Public necessity is a complete privilege in that you're not required to pay damages.

#### Public Necessity
* Privilege to enter land or destroy property out of necessity if: 
	* it's for the purpose of avoiding imminent public disaster 
	* **OR** actor reasonably believes its necessary to avoid imminent public disaster

#### Ploof v. Putnam
* Cause of action was trespass to chattels, but it should really have been conversion because the boat was destroyed
* Necessity was an affirmative defense against trespass
* If Ploofs are privileged to be on the dock (due to necessity) then its not trespassing, and so Putnam can't kick them off.
* This case is private necessity rather than public necessity
* We value life over property
* The standard for private necessity is serious harm or death.

#### Vincent v. Lake Erie Transportation Co.
* When there's property damage, the person claiming the privilege is responsible to pay the damages.
* Private necessity is an incomplete privilege. All it allows you to do is avoid trespassing, but you're still required to pay damages.
 
#### Private Necessity
* Privilege to enter or remain on property iff: 
	1. it's necessary
	2. **OR** it appears necessary
		* for the purpose of avoiding serious harm to actor or land or chattels
		* for the purpose of avoiding serious harm to 3rd parties or their land or chattels
	3. Where the actor is responsible for actual damages to land or chattels.

## Negligence
* Broad category of torts
* Conduct that creates an unreasonable risk of harm
