# Torts

## August 27
* Office hours after class

### Goals of Torts
* Justice (fairness)
* Deterrence
* Efficiency/Utility - The car manufacturer is a more efficient risk assesser than the driver whose brakes fail.
* Compensation
* Process/Administrability

### Bases for assigning blame
* Intent
* Reasonableness - If Ann could reasonably expect that her brakes might fail, we would be more likely to assign liability

Insurance is an alternative to the tort system

### Tort law approaches
* **Strict liability** - Everyone is liable, regardless of fault
	* Pros:
		* Very efficient
		* Maximizes compensation
	* Cons:
		* Eliminates deterrent effect
		* One size fits all--no room to assign any blame to victims
* **Intentional** - You intended to do it, you're liable (just Cain)
	* Pros:
		* Most just, since it assigns blame to all and only those who intended to do harm
* **Negligence** - If you didn't act reasonably, you're liable

### General characteristics of the tort system
* Tort law covers civil cases between parties where facts are disputed in order to assign compensation
* How much is my autonomy limited by my responsibility?

## August 28
* Settlement may be reached at any point throughout the process, and most cases do settle.

### Appeals
#### NC
* In NC, the appeals process begins in the Superior Court.
* Next up is the Court of Appeals.
* Finally to NC Supreme Court
* Superior Court > Court of Appeals > Supreme Court
#### NY
* Supreme Court > Supreme Court, Appellate Division > Court of Appeals
#### Federal
* District court > Circuit Court of Appeals > SCOTUS
### Holden v. Wal-Mart
* Award for the plaintiff was probably not sufficient to achieve deterrence.
* Facts matter. What do I know? What do I need to know that I don't know?
### Damages
* Compensatory
	* Past
		* Lost wages
		* Medical expenses
		* Pain & suffering
	* Future
		* Diminished earning capacity
		* Future medical treatment
		* Future pain & suffering
* Punitive
	* Meant to punish
* Potential for future damages must be proven.

## August 30
### Snyder v. Turk
* Liable for battery when an individual acts intending harmful **or** offensive contact **and** a harmful **or** offensive contact results.
* Contact that is offensive to a **reasonable** sense of personal dignity is sufficiently offensive to constitute battery.

### Cohen v. Smith
* Battery can occur if the defendant intentionally causes a contact that is offensive to the plaintiff even if it would not be offensive to others.
* Knowledge on the part of the defendant is extremely important to determining intent. Defendant in Cohen knew consent for contact was not given & was therefore liable. In Mullins the defendant did not know & was not liable.

### Van Camp v. McAfoos
* Facts in the record must support fault

## September 4
* Much of tort law is socially constructed.
* Battery as a tort was historically intended to discourage violence.
* Restatements -
	* Published by the American Law Institute
	* Meant to clarify the common law on a topic
	* Strongly persuasive secondary authority
	* Shows a judge how the law is being applied in other jurisdictions
* If a defendant reasonably believes plaintiff had consented to the touching there can be no liability for battery
* No intent
* Weapons, being instruments under your control, may be used in battery.

### Garratt v. Dailey
* Intent requires:
	* purpose of causing contact, **or**
	* knowledge that contact is substantially certain
* No volition, no fault.
* Subjective inquiry - determining what a party was thinking.
