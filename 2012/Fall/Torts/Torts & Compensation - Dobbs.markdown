# Torts & Compensation - Dobbs

## Tort Law: Aims, Approaches and Processes
### What is Tort Law?
* *Tort* -- Any event that, according to the law, may be grounds for a lawsuit.
	* Some entity (person, corporation) must be harmed
	* The party that was harmed has a "cause of action" against whomever committed the tort
* Separate from contracts. A contract violation is usually not a tort.
* Torts may also be crimes.
* Tort law protects the rights of individuals and corrects private wrongs, whereas criminal law protects the public interest.
* *Non-tort systems* -- Injuries may also be addressed through private, non-tort arrangements (e.g worker's comp insurance)
* Main questions in tort law:
	1. What kind of actions are harmful (tortious)?
	2. Did the action cause tortious harm?
	3. How may a defendant argue that she was not responsible for tortious harm?

### The Aims & Approaches of Tort Law--Justice and Policy, Compensation and Deterrence 
#### Aims of tort law
* There are a few systems of thought on which tort law may be based. Some of these are in conflict with each other.

1. **Morality or  corrective justice**
	* Tort law may be based on a system of (individual?) moral responsibility
	* People should be held responsible for harms they wrongfully caused
	* Tort law defines the cases in which one party may be liable to another due to some harm they caused such that the first party must compensate the second.
2. **Social utility or policy**
	* Tort law may be based on promoting the good of society
	* Opposite to the moral aim of tort law
3. **Process**
	* Tort law must create rules that are intelligible to and enforceable by courts while also leaving minimal room for interpretive whim.
	* The litigation process determined by those rules is itself a good, separate from its basis in morality or social utility

##### Potential Conflicts
* 1 & 2  may conflict with each other as justifications for regulations
* Both systems may converge on the same types of regulation but they also may not
* The tension between #1 and #2 rests on the potential conflict between the social goods and the rights of individuals.
* Similarly, #3 may conflict with both #1 and #2.

#### Ideas of Corrective Justice
* Requiring a defendant at fault to compensate the person they harmed is consistent with the corrective justice basis for tort law.
* Similarly, the corrective justice approach says that a faultless defendant should not be so required
* The social policy basis allows that the government may compensate the harmed party in the case of a faultless defendant. This does not go against the corrective justice basis.
* *Strict liability* - Liability imposed without fault (I'm liable when someone breaks your lawnmower while I'm borrowing it--*if* there is a norm establishing such liability).
* **Gains & losses** - One may argue for strict liability by saying that if I stand to gain from my actions, I should also be responsible for losses incurred due to those actions. This is consistent with corrective justice principles.
* At the end of the day, most tort law is based on corrective justice principles, and assumes the necessity of fault.

#### Compensation, Risk Distribution, Fault
* *Risk distribution or loss spreading* - One could argue for expanding liability (such as through adopting strict liability) as a way of
	1. maximizing the total compensation of harmed parties, and
	2. expanding the base from which that compensation may be drawn
* If you hold a product manufacturer liable for any harm their products cause, they can raise prices on their products thus distributing the costs of compensating the harmed parties.
* Arguments like this are not well supported in the common law, with fault & corrective justice still dominating tort jurisprudence.  

##### Arguments against risk spreading
1. It may be argued that expanding liability in this way is more appropriately done by legislators than by jurists. To that end, some states have strict liability built into their workers' comp laws in order to pass the cost of compensation claims on to workers by lowering wages and to consumers by raising prices.
2. Strict liability undermines the deterrent effect of compensation claims(?)
3. The tort system is an expensive way to handle compensation cases when there are alternatives.

#### Fostering Freedom, Deterring Unsafe Conduct; Economic Analysis
* Tort law may deter certain kinds of activity if that activity is likely to cause harm (and therefore impose liability)
* Corrective justice & social policy advocates both may invoke deterrence as the justification for particular tort laws, though not usually the same laws.
* When analyzing a tort claim through the prism of economics, a judge may find that the social utility of a behavior is greater than the harm it causes and so deny or reduce compensation on the grounds that the behavior should not be deterred.
* Utility & efficiency so construed may conflict with fairness & justice.

#### Process Values in Tort Law
* Any legal process should promote a feeling of engagement by the involved parties.
* Efficiency should be a goal in structuring process.
* Process rules should be sufficiently concrete so as to constrain the possible decisions a jurist may make.
* Rules should conversely allow some flexibility.
* When courts must choose between values of efficiency and fairness, they generally weight fairness more heavily.
* Process should enable some predictability of outcomes

### Applying Some Approaches
* *Conversion* - A tort in which one person uses another person's property as if it were their own or represents that the property was their own. Conversion may occur even though the party using the property or claiming ownership is unaware of the property's status.
* When policy & justice are in conflict, which should prevail?

### Implementing Tort Law Purposes with Damage Awards 
#### Holden v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc
* Nebraska, 2000
* Since the citation only has the state ("Neb.") we know it's the highest court in the state.
* Bad knee falls in parking lot, gets knee replaced. wants more money in damages but doesn't get it.

* **Parties**
	* Plaintiff - Appellant: Debra J. Holden, knee replacement costing $25k after stepping in a hole in a Wal-Mart parking lot
	* Defendant - Appellee: Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Owner of the parking lot.

* **Procedural History**
	* Jury determined total damages to be $6000
	* Jury found Holden 40% negligent and Wal-Mart 60% negligent
	* From this, jury awarded Holden damages in the amount of $3600.
	* Holden appealed, saying that the jury had miscalculated the damages.

* **Facts**
	* She was parked in a handicap spot, where there was a hole
	* Appellant stepped in a hole in a Wal-Mart parking lot causing her to injure her knee which was subsequently replaced.
	* Holden already needed a new knee, but testimony from an orthopedic surgeon held that the fall hastened the need for the surgery
	* Lower limb impairment before fall was 87% before the fall and 97% after.
	* Total body impairment was 35% before & 39% after.
	* ER visit cost $646.75
	* Subsequent knee replacement cost $24,707.91

* **Issues**
	* Was the award miscalculated?
	* Was is excessive or inadequate (did it "shock the conscience")?

* **Rule**
	* There is a very high standard for overturning the verdict or amending an award. There must be obvious prejudice or some similar inappropriate injection of emotion.

* **Holding**
	* The record supports the jury's conclusion that the injury caused only a small portion of the appellant's medical bills.
	* The jury was correct in its award (Affirmed).

* **Reasoning**
	* The knee was already bad enough to need replacing & it's unclear how much the fall sped up the need for that procedure.

* **Notes**
	* *remittitur* - Ability of a judge to reduce a damage award determined by a civil jury.
	* *additur* - Ability of a judge to add a damage award determined by a civil jury.
	* Typical bases for compensatory damages include:
		1. Lost wages or earning capacity
		2. Medical expenses
		3. Pain & suffering ("freedom from pain has economic value")
	* Punitive damages may be awarded in order to enhance the deterrent effect of the judgment and/or punish the defendant.
	* In the US, the losing party is not required to pay the winner's attorney fees. Usually, attorneys aren't paid anything if they lose & get between 25%-40% of the award if they win.
	* The median award in tort cases ($24k) is less than that in contract cases ($35k)

## Reading Torts Cases: Trial Procedures
### Looking for Facts, Rules, and Reasons
* Some notes about how to brief tort cases:
  * Facts: Identify facts upon which the judge bases the decision as well as
    those that determine the scope of rule, provide context for the case and any
    that help you remember
  * Procedural history & Procedural issues: Tort decisions often turn on the
    decision-making authorities of the judge and jury
  * Substantive issues: Separate from procedural issues. "Should the lower
    court's motion be upheld" is a procedural issue. "Is intent to harm require
    for battery" is a substantive issue.
  * Holding & rules: Whether a judgment was upheld, reversed, etc. as well as
    whatever rule of law the court used in answering the substantive issue(s).
  * Reasoning: Why the rule of the case exists (if it is from a precedent) or
    why she created it (if it is novel).
  * Application of rules: How do the rules apply to the facts of the case
  * The rule of the case indicates to the lawyers what evidence is needed and
    what arguments may be used.

### Procedures at Trial
* Two kinds of disputes in a trial:
	1. What are the facts?
	2. What is the law? How should it apply in this case?
* Cases may not always "get to the jury" if a judge prevents the jury from hearing them. Lawyers first evaluate cases by asking whether they can get to the jury.
* Procedural steps (√ = important to tort cases):
	* **Complaint (aka petition)**: Document from the plaintiff's lawyer stating the facts as they see them. Filed formally with the court & delivered
    (served) to the defendant.
	* √ **Motion to dismiss or demurrer**: Defendant's lawyers may say that the facts of the complaint do not constitute a legal claim and the complaint should be dismissed. (A "demurrer" is a pleading that argues that the facts in the opposing side's pleading, such as a complaint, should not be the basis of a claim). It's a "demurrer" in common law and a "motion to dismiss" in federal rule proceedings.
	* **Answer**: The defendant addresses the complaint, usually by disputing the
    facts.
	* **Discovery**: Both sides of the case try to find information about the claims from the parties in the case as well as from others who may have knowledge of relevant facts. Both parties may conduct oral interviews and request records.
	* √ **Motion for summary judgment**: After discovery, one party (usually the defendant) will argue that there isn't a dispute about the facts of the case and thus that the judge should rule summarily for them,
	* **Pretrial briefs and motions in limine**: Both parties may submit briefs arguing that certain types of evidence or legal rules should or should not be considered during trial. *in limine* means "at the start."
	* **Jury selection**: Lawyers ask questions of potential jurors in order to determine potential bias. They make "strike" jurors.
	* **Opening statements**: Plaintiff's lawyer goes first.
	* **Plaintiff's case**: plaintiff's lawyer calls witnesses & defense may cross-examine
	* √ **Motion for directed verdict**: Defense may argue that the plaintiff's case is insufficient for the court to rule for them.
		* Similar to motion to dismiss or for summary judgement, but also considers the evidence produced at trial.
		* Will not be granted if there may be room for jurors to disagree.
	* **Defendant's case**.
	* **Objections to evidence & Offers of evidence**.
	* **Closing arguments**. Plaintiff goes first. These are arguments--not statements of fact.  
	* *** Proposed instructions to the jury & objections**: The judge instructs jurors what burdens of proof are necessary for each side. Each lawyer proposes instructions to which the other may object. Jury instructions must correctly state the law. Many appeals are based on the idea that jury instructions misstated the law.
	* **Jury verdict.**
	* **Motion J.N.O.V**. (*non obstinate veredicto*--notwithstanding the verdict) Post-trial motion for Judgment as a matter of law: Replay of the motion for directed verdict.
	* **Motion for a new trial**: A new trial may be granted if:
		1. The judge finds an error in how the trial was conducted; or
		2. The verdict or award is incommensurate with the weight of the evidence.
	* **Appeals**: When an appeals court reverses a lower court's decision, the trial starts back up at the point in the process where it left off back in the lower court.

## Establishing a Claim for Intentional Tort to Person or Property
* A plaintiff has to state things they intend to prove that would make their claim successful.
* This is the "prima facie case"
* The plaintiff bears the burden of proof for the prima facie case of a tort

### Battery 
#### Requiring Fault 
##### Van Camp v. McAFoos
* Iowa, 1968, J. Becker
* Tricycle accident

* **Parties**
* Van Camp - hurt achilles
* McAfoos - 3 year-old tricycle rider

* **Facts**
	* McAfoos was riding a tricycle on a public sidewalk and hit Van Camp from
	  behind, injuring her achilles.
	* Achilles needed surgery.
	* Plaintiff didn't allege that McAfoos was negligent or intended to harm her.
	* Plaintiff asserted a right to walk on the sidewalk without being injured.

* **Procedural History**
	* Trial court sustained defendant's motion to dismiss on the grounds that the plaintiff didn't actually state a cause of action.

* **Issue**
	* Is alleging an injury sufficient to state a cause of action or must the plaintiff allege fault.

* **Holding**
	* Affirmed. Without negligence or intent to harm, there is no basis for a tort 
	* No liability without fault.

* **Reasoning**
	* The plaintiff alleged neither intent nor negligence, so on procedural grounds, there's no prima facie case, and
	* Without intent or negligence, there's no fault, so there's no liability.

* **Rule**
	* No fault, no liability.
	* Without a cause of action, there can be no suit.

* **Notes**
	* Insurance is a big driver of torts cases.

#### Elements of Battery
* Battery - intentional physical harm
* Torts protect against:
	* Physical injury to person or property
	* Injury to dignity
	* Economic harm
* Torts may be based on:
	* Intent or malice
	* Negligence
	* Strict liability (no fault)

##### Snyder v. Turk
* Ohio Ct. App., 1993, Judge Wilson

* **Parties**
	* π: Snyder - scrub nurse
	* ∂: Turk - Grabby Dr.
	* Sticking someone's face in a wound is offensive & battery

* **Facts**
	* Snyder was the scrub nurse on a Gall bladder operation performed by surgeon, Dr. Turk
	* Procedure went poorly
	* Turk was frustrated & making mistakes (according to Snyder)
	* Snyder handed Turk an instrument Turk considered to be the wrong one
	* Turk grabbed Snyder's shoulder and sticks her face near the surgical opening

* **Procedural History**
	* Trial court granted directed verdict in favor of Turk on the grounds that he didn't intend to harm Snyder
	* Snyder appealed the directed verdict.

* **Issue**
	* Is Turk liable for tortious battery even though he didn't intend to *physically* harm Snyder? Is there injury beyond physical injury.

* **Reasoning**
	* Though there was no evidence of physical injury, Turk intended to offend, and did offend.
	* Turk offended Snyder's "reasonable sense of personal dignity"

* **Holding**
	* Original determination of fault was correct & directed verdict was incorrect since the harm of appellant's dignity constitutes battery

* **Rule**
	* Either physical harm or harm to someone's dignity may constitute battery

##### Cohen v. Smith
* Ill. Ct. of App. 1995, J. Chapman
* Male nurse touched the naked orthodox lady - battery

* **Parties**
	* π: Cohen - Patient, C-Section
	* ∂: Smith - Male nurse on hospital staff

* **Facts**
	* Cohen was told she needed a c-section
	* Cohen & her husband told her Dr. that their religious beliefs prohibited Cohen from being seen naked or having her naked body touched by any men.
	* Cohen's Dr. agreed to honor this request.
	* Smith, male nurse on staff, observed & touched Cohen's naked body during her c-section

* **Procedural History**
	* Trial court granted Smith's motion to dismiss saying that Cohen didn't state a cause of action

* **Issue**
	* Did Cohen's allegation of being seen and touched against her wishes constitute offense?

* **Reasoning**
	* Even though most people realize that going in for surgery means they will likely be seen & touched by members of both sexes, the Cohens explicitly stated that they didn't want this to happen and that this was a matter of religious faith.
	* The courts respect other religious instructions in medical care, such as Jehovah's Witnesses refusing to receive transfusions.
	* Adults can decide what happens to their own bodies, even in the context of medical care.

* **Holding**
	* The dismissal was reversed. Cohen had a cause of action for (1)battery and (2)intentional infliction of emotional distress. Liability extends to harm to dignity (liability can be established for "contacts...which are merely offensive and insulting")

* **Rule**
	* Battery can occur if the defendant intentionally causes a contact that is offensive to the plaintiff even if it would not be offensive to others.

##### Mullins v. Parkview Hospital
* Indiana, 2007, J. Sullivan
* Bad intubation without intent to harm -- no battery

* **Parties**
	* π: Mullins - Hysterectomy patient
	* ∂: Parkview Hospital Inc. - Corporation operating the hospital where Mullins's surgery was performed
	* VanHoey? - The EMT performing the intubation

* **Facts**
	* Mullins told her gyno that she wanted privacy during her surgery
	* Mullins crossed out a line on the consent form about consenting to have "healthcare learners" present in the surgery
	* Anesthesiologist told Mullins before the surgery that she would do the anesthesia herself.
	* When Mullins was unconscious, the anesthesiologist let an EMT student (VanHoey) practice intubating Mullins.
	* It was the EMT student's first day intubating live patients
	* VanHoey *had* successfully intubated another patient earlier that day
	* EMT lacerated Mullins's esophagus
	* Mullins needed more surgery & longer recuperation time due to the new injury
	* VanHoey was not in a position to know that Mullins altered her consent form

* **Procedural History**
	* Trial court granted summary judgment for the defendant.
	* Appeals court said Mullins has a battery claim against VanHoey, the gynecologist, the anesthesiologist and the doctors' practices.
	* VanHoey appealed

* **Issue**
	* Did VanHoey's harmful contact with Mullins constitute battery though she did not intend to harm her?
	* Does the defendant need to know that plaintiff didn't consent to the contact in order for it to be battery?

* **Reasoning**
	* Even granting that VanHoey harmed Mullins, she did not intend to do so and she could not have known of Mullins's objection to her contact.
	* It was reasonable for VanHoey to not know Mullins hadn't consented.

* **Holding**
	* Defendant must know contact was not consented to in order to constitute battery.
	* The initial granting of summary judgment for VanHoey was correct
	* If a defendant reasonably believes plaintiff had consented to the touching there can be no liability for battery

* **Rule**
	* Harmful contact without intent to harm does not constitute battery

* **Notes**
	* Could Mullins have argued negligence? Is there such a thing as negligent battery?
	
##### A.R.B. v. Elkin
* Mo. Ct. App. 2003

* **Parties**
	* π: A.R.B. - male & female children?
	* ∂: Elkin - Father of A.R.B?
	* Father sexually abused kids

* **Facts**
	* A.R.B. used to live with their father but no longer do.
	* A.R.B. allege their father sexually abused them on numerous occasions.
	* Elkin admitted to the abuse.
	* Some instances of abuse involved physical touching.

* **Procedural History**
	* Trial judge rejected damages claim to pay for counseling, saying the medical bills were not provided in discovery.
	* Trial judge also rejected damages for emotional harm saying no evidence demonstrating such harm was supplied
	* Male plaintiff got $100 in "nominal" damages because he was physically harmed.
	* Female plaintiff got no damage.
	* Presumably A.R.B. appealed the damages?

* **Issue**
	* Should damage awards account for magnitude of emotional harm?

* **Holding**
	* Reversed & sent back to trial court. Evidence of emotional injury is not required when it can be medically diagnosed. Punitive damages should also be considered.

* **Reasoning**
	* Evidence of emotional injury is not required when it can be medically diagnosed.

* **Rule**
	* Damages should be commensurate with the degree of harm.

* **Notes**
	* Nominal damages are small awards to acknowledge liability.
	* Shock the conscience?
	* *tortfeasor* - committer of a tort

#### Defining Intent

##### Garratt v. Dailey
* Wash 1955, J. Hill
* A young child pulls a chair out from behind an adult

* **Parties**
	* π: Naomi Garratt -
	* ∂: Dailey - 5y,9m old

* **Facts**
	* Dailey was visiting Garratt and her sister (Ruth Garratt) at Garratt's home
	* Naomi Garratt alleges that Dailey pulled the chair out from Ruth Garratt as she was sitting down, causing her to fall.
	* Ruth Garratt did not testify as to how she fell.
	* Dailey claims he moved the chair before Garratt was moving to sit down.
	* When he saw Garratt moving to sit where she thought the chair was, he immediately got up and tried to replace the chair behind her.
	* Due to his size and youthful lack of dexterity, he was unsuccessful.
	* Garratt hit the ground and broke her hip.
	* The trial court calculated damages of $11,000 before reaching a verdict.

* **Procedural History**
	* Trial court accepted Dailey's account and finding no intent to harm Garratt, dismissed the case.
	* Garratt appealed the dismissal asking for either the amount previously decided or a new trial.

* **Issue**
	* Did Dailey intend to harm Garratt if he didn't know his action would bring about harm?

* **Reasoning**
	* Regardless of age, there may be no liability without intent
	* Intent requires that the act must be done specifically to cause harm or with the knowledge that the act will cause harm.
	* Further, that knowledge must be *substantially certain* to cause harmful
	  contact. If the defendant believed that his action would bring about the risk of contact, the best you can do is negligence or recklessness.
	* Dailey's age matters only inasmuch as it contributes to the court's understanding of what he knew.

* **Holding**
	* We need to know more about whether or not defendant knew he was harming plaintiff in order to determine intent.
	* Remanded to the trial court to get more information about what Dailey knew.

* **Rule**
	* Intent requires purpose **or** knowledge with substantial certainty that performing some action will bring about contact.

* **Notes**
	* When a minor commits a tort with force, he is generally liable. ("with force?")
	* Follow up: read Restatement (3rd) of Torts: Liability for Physical Harm § 1 (cmt e regards the limits of substantial certainty intent)

##### White v. Muniz
* Colo. 2000, J. Kourlis

* **Parties**
	* π: White - Granddaughter of patient
	* ∂: Muniz - caregiver supervisor
	* Alzheimer's patient punches a nurse. Intent to contact without intent to harm -- battery

* **Facts**
	* October, 1993: White admitted her 83 year-old grandmother (Helen Everly) to the Beatrice Hover Personal Care Center, an assisted living facility.
	* A few days after admission, Everly started acting aggressively towards others, becoming agitated easily, and generally behaving erratically.
	* She was diagnosed with progressive dementia, loss of memory, impulse control & judgment due to degenerative alzheimer's dementia.
	* November 21, 1993: A caregiver attempted to change Everly's diaper. The caregiver reported to Muniz that Everly was uncooperative.
	* Muniz believed that to be consistent with her past behavior.
	* Everly refused to let Muniz change her diaper.
	* Muniz thought that Everly eventually consented, though when she reached for the diaper, Everly hit her on the law & told her to leave.

* **Procedural History**
	* Trial court judge instructed the jury that Everly could still act intentionally, dementia notwithstanding, and that they needed to determine 1) if she intended to make contact with Muniz, and 2) whether she knew the contact would be offensive.
	* Trial jury found for Everly.
	* Muniz appealed on the basis that (2) was a misstatement of the law.
	* Court of appeals determined the trial judge gave correct instruction to the jury and reversed.

* **Issue**
	* Does intentional tort require that the person committing the act do so with intent to harm or offend?

* **Reasoning**
	* If Ivan punches Apollo with the intent to knock the wind out of him, but that punch results in far more serious injury, Ivan is liable for the full extent of Apollo's injury. Even though he didn't know his action would cause the specific harm he caused, he knew it would cause harm, and that was his intent.
	* Though we can't read mind to discern intent, we can set a threshold where if a person of "reasonable intelligence" would believe with substantial certainty that their action would cause harm, then we may ascribe that intent to them.
	* Without a dual intent requirement for battery, a friend patting another friend on the back (an intentional contact with no malice)  would be liable for battery if that pat somehow resulted in the friend's injury.
	* We assume that the original jury believed that Everly's mental state was such that she could intend battery. This is not a foregone conclusion any time someone has diminished mental capacity, though it makes it harder to find that intent.

* **Holding**
	* Colorado law requires dual intent--that is, that the defendant intend 1) to make contact, and 2) to cause harm through that contact. The instruction to the jury was correct and the original verdict is reinstated.

* **Rule**
	* In CO, Intent requires intent to harm--maliciousness.

##### Wagner v. State
* Utah, 2005
* Mental patient attacks a lady. UT not a dual-intent state. Intent to contact,
  no intent to harm -- battery

* **Parties**
	* π: Wagner
	* ∂: State (UT)

* **Facts**
	* Wagner was waiting in line at a department store.
	* She was attacked by Sam Giese, a mentally disabled patient at the store as part of a state-sponsored treatment program.

* **Procedural History**
	* UT state law holds that the state is not liable for the conduct of patients in its care if that conduct "arose out of battery"
	* At trial, Wagner argued that the assault was not a battery, since battery requires intent to harm, and Giese was unable to form such intent.
	* State argued that intent to make contact was sufficient for battery.
	* Trial agreed that there was battery & dismissed the complaint.
	* Appeals court upheld the dismissal.

* **Issue**
	* Is intent to make contact sufficient for battery or must the intent be to harm?

* **Reasoning**
	* As long as there is (1) intent to make contact, and (2) that contact meets a legal standard of harm, that is sufficient to establish battery.
	* If a stranger in a crowd gives a woman an unsolicited kiss, and he did not mean to offend her, we still want to be able to call that battery in the interests of preserving the poor woman's bodily integrity.

* **Holding**
	* Affirmed. Giese's contact constituted battery.

* **Rule**
	* In Utah, Battery requires just the intent to make contact and that that
  contact is harmful

##### Stoshak v. East Baton Rouge Parish School
* La. Ct. App 2007
* Teacher punched in the middle of a fight. Transferred intent. Battery.

* **Parties**
	* π: Stoshak - a teacher at EBRPS
	* ∂: East Baton Rouge Parish School

* **Facts**
	* Stoshak was attempting to break up a fight when he was struck in the back the head by one of the two fighting students
	* Stoshak was knocked unconscious.
	* Stoshak in a affidavit said that he didn't believe either of the boys intended to hit him, but that his injury was due to the intensity of fight.

* **Procedural History**
	* LA's "assault pay provision" would entitle Shostak for more disability payments if his injuries were due to battery by a student while he was acting in an official capacity as a teacher.
	* Trial court said Shostak was not the victim of battery.

* **Issue**
	* Is it battery when someone moves to make contact with the intent to harm, but victim is someone other than the intended target of that harm?

* **Reasoning**
	* LA courts have 'transferred intent' where, if someone intends to cause harm to another person, but misses their target and hits someone else, intent to harm is transferred to that 3rd person and the attacker is still liable.
	* The drafters of the "assault pay provision" presumably knew that battery was so defined in the state.
	* The provision does not explicitly state that the teacher must be the original intended target of the harm in order to be eligible to receive the benefit.

* **Holding**
	* Reversed. Intent to harm was transferred to Shostak, and he was thus a victim of battery.

* **Rule**
	* In LA, intent may be transferred from the originally intended target of harmful contact to the eventual, possibly accidental, victim of that contact.

##### Baska v. Scherzer
* Kan. 2007
* Girl punched while breaking up a fight. Transferred intent. Battery (not negligence). Statute of limitations run.

* **Parties**
	* π: Baska
	* ∂: Scherzer

* **Facts**
	* Baska lets her daughter, Ashley, who is a senior in high school, throw a scavenger hunt party
	* Around 12AM, Scherzer & Calvin Madrigal get in a fist fight.
	* Baska tried yelling at the boys to get them to stop fighting.
	* Baska got between them, took a punch to face, lost several teeth and sustained injuries to her neck and jaw.

* **Procedural History**
	* Baska sued both Scherzer & Madrigal for personal injuries.
	* Scherzer & Madrigal both testified that each intended only to hit the other.
	* Scherzer & Madrigal filed for summary judgment, saying that the 1-year statute of limitations on battery had elapsed
	* The statute of limitations on negligence was longer than 1 year and had not run out.
	* Summary judgment for the defendants was granted on those grounds.

* **Issue**
	* Was Baska's cause of action negligence or battery?

* **Reasoning**
	* Because Scherzer & Madrigal intended to hit each other, but hit Baska instead, intent was transferred to her.
	* Since the harm caused to Baska meets the criteria for battery, that is her cause of action.
	* However, since that is her cause of action, the statue of limitations had indeed run out.

* **Holding**
	* Affirmed summary judgment.

* **Rule**
*

### Assault 
#### Cullison v. Medley
* Ind. 1991, J. Krahulik

* **Parties**
	* π: Cullison
	* ∂: Medley

* **Facts**
	* Cullison met Sandy Medley in a grocery store parking lot.
	* They exchanged pleasantries
	* Cullison invited Medley for a Coke & to come to his home
	* Later Cullison was asleep when he was awoken by a knock on the door
	* He answered the door & could see there was someone there, & heard a female voice say she needed to talk to him.
	* He returned to his room to get dressed.
	* When he arrived back in the living room, Sandy Medley, her father Ernest, brother Ron, mother Doris, and brother-in-law Terry Simmons were standing there.
	* Ernest was on crutches & had a revolver holstered on his thigh.
	* Sandy & her mother called Cullison "sick" and "pervert" and otherwise verbally berated him.
	* Doris kept her hand in her pocket in such a way that it indicated to Cullison that she had a gun as well.
	* Ernest kept rattling the gun as if he were going to pull it.
	* Ernest threatened to "jump astraddle" of Cullison if he didn't leave Sandy alone.
	* No one ever actually touched Cullison, though he feared he would be shot due to the motions Ernest was making while he threatened Cullison.
	* As the Medleys left, Cullison suffered chest pains leading him to think he was having a heart attack.
	* Later, at a restaurant, Cullison claims that Ernest glared at him in a threatening manner while again armed with a handgun
	* Cullison went into psychological counseling due to his fear of the Medleys.
	* He also took psychiatric medication that prevented him from operating heavy machinery which impaired his ability to work in his sole proprietership construction business.
	* He claimed to suffer from nervousness, sleeplessness, depression, difficulty concetrating, and impotence due to his interactions with the Medleys

* **Procedural History**
	* Cullison sued the Medleys for assault (among other torts)
	* Trial court granted summary judgment for Medley
	* Appeals court affirmed the decision, saying that since the gun stayed in the holster & the threat to "jump astraddle" of Cullison was conditional on Cullison interacting further with Sandy.

* **Issue**
	* Did the Medleys verbal threats and menacing behavior toward Cullison constitute assault even though no physical contact occurred.

* **Reasoning**
	* Assault occurs when someone acts intending to cause battery or the fear of imminent battery.
	* "It is [a] right to be free from the apprehension of battery"

* **Holding**
	* The jury should have determined whether the Medleys verbal threats and rattling of handguns would have given a reasonable person fear of imminent harmful contact.

* **Rule**
	* An assault is an act that would cause a reasonable person to apprehend battery

* **Notes**
	* "Apprehension" - "an awareness of imminent touching that would be battery if completed."

#### Notes on Assault
* As with transferred intent in battery, intent may also transfer from one tort to another. If I throw a rock at you aiming to miss and scare you (intent to assault), but accidentally hit you, the intent to assault becomes intent to batter.

### False imprisonment
#### McCann v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
* 1st Cir. 2000

* **Parties**
	* π: McCann - family detained by wal-mart employees
	* ∂: Wal-Mart

* **Facts**
	* Debra McCann & two of her kids (aged 16 & 12) were shopping at a wal-mart
	* They had a receipt stamped 10:10 pm
	* Two wal-mart employees stopped the mccanns from leaving the store standing in front of and possibly placing a hand on their cart
	* The employees said that the children weren't allowed in the store since they had previously been caught stealing.
	* This was not true. The employees had mixed up the boy with another boy who did steal.
	* The McCanns believed they had to remain in the store, so they went with the employees who, while they said they were calling the police, were actually calling a security guard who could identify the kid who shoplifted.
	* There was always a wal-mart employee watching the McCanns and they did not allow Jonathan to use the restroom.
	* The guard said that it was not the McCann child who shoplifted.
	* The employees acknowledged the mistake.
	* The McCanns left the store at 11:15 pm

* **Procedural History**
	* Trial jury awarded the McCanns $20k damages for false imprisonment.
	* Wal-mart appealed.

* **Issue**
	* Did the wal-mart employees' detention of the McCanns constitute confinement and false imprisonment.

* **Reasoning**
	* Neither physical restraint nor physical boundaries are required to establish confinement.
	* Threat of physical force or implied threat of physical force may establish confinement.
	* Incorrect assertion of legal authority to confine also suffices.
	* All of the above constitute "duress"
	* The reference to the police, the instruction given to the McCanns, and continued presence of the employees are enough to make a reasonable person believe either that the employees would physically restrain the McCanns if they attempted to leave, that the store had the legal authority to detain them, or both.

* **Holding**
	* False imprisonment. The wal-mart employees confined the McCanns in the store and the McCanns were aware of it.

* **Rule**
	* False imprisonment occurs when an actor "confines" someone "within boundaries fixed by the actor" and the victim is aware of or harmed by the confinement.
	* The threat of physical force, or the implication of legal authority to detain is sufficient to establish confinement (there needn't be any physical contact).

* **Notes**
	* Being *excluded* from a place isn't confinement

## Property Torts
### Trespass to land
* Intent to enter upon land of another
* **AND** D actually enters the land
* **OR** D causes an object to enter P's land

### Conversion of chattels--Trover
* *Trover*: Tortfeasor intends to exercise "substantial dominion"
* Intent to convert does *not* require awareness of wrongdoing as long as conversion interferes with the rightful owner's right to exercise control over the chattel
* "substantial dominion" takes into account:
	* extent & duration of control
	* D's intent to claim the property
	* D's good faith
	* Harm done
	* Expense or inconvenience caused
* Liability in trover is for the full value of the chattel
* Applies *mostly* to tangible & not symbolic or notional goods, but there are exceptions. No trover with money, but yes for stocks.
* A claim of trover re: embryos survived demurrer (i.e. is a legitimate cause of action). Court said because it was genetic material.
* A different court said no conversion for blood.
* Aiding & abetting conversion counts as conversion.
* Conversions can be chained. I convert a watch & sell it to you, you're now a converter, too. Rightful owner could sure either or both of us, but could only get one damage award.
* Uniform Commercial Code gives businesses the ability to transfer ownership rights from the "entrustor" to a purchaser.
* Sometimes, if the price of chattel goes up, a damage award may be for the current market value. Or it may be awarded in kind or as an injunction.

### Trespass to chattels
* Even if I don't take substantial dominion of your chattel, but cause harm to you by preventing you from using it or interfering with your enjoyment of it, that is a tort. (DDoS)
* Interference must result in harm to the physical condition, quality, or value of the chattel

## Emotional Harm
### Intentional infliction of emotional distress
* D's **extreme and outrageous behavior** recklessly or intentionally causes **severe** emotional disturbance to another. D is liable for that disturbance as well as for any physical damage that results.
	* Intent: D acts with the purpose of bringing about the emotional disturbance. 
	* **OR** Recklessness: D has to know that his actions may cause emotional disturbance (or know facts that will make it obvious--disturbance is **substantially certain** to result) and doesn't do anything to mitigate that risk.
* *Scienter* - knowledge of wrongdoing. Here, scienter is broad than battery, since the act doesn't have to have to purpose of harming.
* Three reasons this broad scienter is okay:
	1. Conduct has to be extreme & outrageous--high bar
		* Recklessness involves balancing the risk of the harm with the difficulty in preventing it. A reckless actor can be more culpable that one who acted with intent if the risk was great but the harm was very easily preventable.
	2. "Severe" is also a high bar.
	3. Unlike battery, there isn't really a fallback to negligence if intent can't be proved, so we want to include recklessness so those victims can recover something.

#### GTE Southwest Inc. v. Bruce
* TX 1999
* Morris Shields engaged in routine threatening, vulgar, degrading behavior towards his employees at GTE.
* Trial ct said his behavior was intentional infliction of emotional distress. TX affirmed.
* Context & relationship between the parties has to be considered when determining whether conduct was extreme & outrageous.
* This was a workplace.
* The behavior was repeated, and continued after victims objected.

#### Notes
* Fact patterns for "extreme & outrageous" often include:
	* repeated or prolonged behavior
	* authority of D over P
	* D knows P to be especially vulnerable
	* One come-on isn't sufficient (*cough*Clinton*cough*), but many can be. 
* Can't be claimed against someone asserting a legal right (e.g. to divorce or fire)
* Has to be a clear, demonstrable causal connection between D's behavior & P's distress.
* Distress has to be very severe, possibly even debilitating.
* Originally created as a catch-all for when no existing tort fit the actual wrongdoing.
* Related statutes:
	* Protection from discrimination against the disabled
	* Sexual harassment
	* Employment discrimination under the Civil Rights Act

#### 1st Amendment considerations
* Intentional or even negligent misstatements may be libelous.

#### Homer v. Long
* MD Ct. Spec. App. 1992, Wilner

* **Parties**
	* π: Homer - aggrieved ex-husband
	* ∂: Long - seducing therapist

* **Facts**
	* P & wife were married for many years before she was hospitalized for depression.
	* Wife's therapist took advantage of her condition & seduced her.
	* Wife's personality changed & she left P.

* **Procedural History**
	* Homer sues Long for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

* **Issue**
	* Can a D be liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress when behavior was directed at a 3rd party when P was not present?

* **Reasoning**
	* D's behavior was extreme & outrageous towards the hospital, inasmuch as it violated codes of professional conduct, and to Mrs. Homer, but not to Homer.
	* No intent directed at Homer.
	* Intent can be transferred to a 3rd party if behavior is directed at:
		* a member of P's immediate family while P is present (whether or not there is bodily harm to P as a result of the distress)
		* any 3rd party if the distress causes bodily harm to P.
	* It is substantially certain that if a husband is murdered in front of his wife that the wife will suffer severe a emotional disturbance.
	* 3rd parties in such cases have to be present **and** known by D to be present
	* In extreme circumstances, presence requirement may be lessened, as in the parents of a child who is molested.
	* The trauma to Homer wasn't any different than if anyone else has seduced his wife.

* **Holding**
	* No liability for intentional infliction of emotional distress when behavior was directed at a 3rd party when P was not present.

* **Notes**
	* Exceptions to presence reqment:
		* Relationship of 3rd party to P
		* Relationship of D to P
		* Egregiousness of the behavior
	* Also, when a 3rd party is involved & P is not present, D must act towards 3rd party *intending* to cause P's distress.
