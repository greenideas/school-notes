# DLRP 
Jeff Nieman
* "20 day"
	* you get an FTA on your record 
	* an automatic extra $200 surcharge
	* DMV is notified
* DMV sends a letter to ∂
* ∂ has 60 days from the FTA date before his license is suspended indefinitely.
* § 20-24.1 - Chapter 20 is the NC motor vehicle code.
* Revocation is indefinite.
* ∂ gets an additional charge.
	* If ∂ is convicted of DWLR, **or** speeding 81 in 65 or less, license will be revoked for at least a year.
* **A moving violation conviction while DWLR results in a one-year suspension.**
## Moving Violations
* Speeding, C&R, Following too close, DWI, failure to yield to an emergency vehicle, no insurance, DWLR, No Operator's License (expired, never got one, don't have it on you), unsafe movement (got in a wreck), open container (if driver--if it's the passenger, it's a non-moving violation), left of center, passing a stopped school bus, child seat/child seatbelt

## Non-moving violations
* taillight, improper equipment (improper equipment: speedometer is a lesser included charge of speeding), expired or improper inspection, adult seatbelt, expired/revoked/fictitious registration, exp. inspection, fictitious info to officer (usually incorrect name), parking in a handicapped space (usually parking tickets don't count, but this one does), failure to notify DMV of an address change, window tint, city ordinance violations

## Alternatives to moving violation conviction (ordinary forms of relief)
### Dismissal or acquittal
* Acquittal (unlikely)
* Outright dismissal of a moving violation (rare)
* Dismissal of non-moving violation
	* Expired inspection, Registration
	* Improper equipment--fix it

### Reduce or Amend to Non-Moving Violation
* Speeding --> Improper equipment (not available if speed > 25 over)
* Stoplight/sign --> city code violation
* DWLR --> Failure to notify DMV of address change

### Prayer for Judgment Continued (PJC)
* Unique to NC
* Guilty, but "no conviction"
* No license or insurance points for that crime & it won't be considered a moving violation
* Only 2 PJCs per *driver* every 5 years for DMV purposes, but 1 PJC/household every 3 years for insurance purposes
* PJC is not available for
	* DWI
	* Passing stopped school bus
	* Speeding >25 over
	* Anyone with a commercial license (class A), regardless of the offense.

## Extraordinary relief
### FTA Sent in error
* Judge tells the clerk to tell the DMV that the FTA was sent in error
* Thus there's no suspension so moving violation didn't occur in a state of suspension

### Nunc pro tunc (now for then)
* Rewrite history by changing the date a conviction, PJC, or other action is entered
* Can be used on open or closed cases. To use on a closed case, you have to get the case reopened.

### Motion for appropriate relief (MAR)
* Allows an old case to be reopened and change what happened in the past. Used when:
	* PJC was used improperly
	* PJC was available & not used
	* Pled to speed when improper was an option

### Criminal charge of FTA
* Ask DA to change § 20 traffic ticket to a criminal charge of misdemeanor FTA (§ 14)
* § 14 isn't a traffic charge, so it's not a moving violation and so DL won't be revoked.

## Limited Driving Privilege
* N.C. Gen. Stat. § 20-20.1 Petition and order
* Court order allowing a person with a revoked license to drive on a limited basis.
 * If you get through a year with a limited driving privilege without any new offenses, license is reinstated.
