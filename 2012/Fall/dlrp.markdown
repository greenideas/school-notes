# DLRP 
Jeff Nieman
* "20 day"
	* you get an FTA on your record 
	* an automatic extra $200 fine
	* DMV is notified
* DMV sends a letter to ∂
* ∂ has 60 days from the FTA date before his license is revoked.
* § 20-24.1 - Chapter 20 is the NC motor vehicle code.
* Revocation is indefinite.
* ∂ gets an additional charge.
	* If ∂ is convicted of DWLR, **or** speeding 81 in 65 or less, license will be revoked for at least a year.
* A moving violation conviction while DWLR results in a one-year suspension.

## Moving Violations
* Speeding, C&R, Following too close, DWI, failure to yield to an emergency vehicle, no insurance, DWLR, No Operator's License (expired, never got one, don't have it on you), unsafe movement (got in a wreck), open container (if driver--if it's the passenger, it's a non-moving violation), left of center, passing a stopped school bus, child seat/child seatbelt

## Non-moving violations
* taillight, improper equipment (improper equipment: speedometer is a lesser included charge of speeding), expired or improper inspection, adult seatbelt, expired/revoked/fictitious registration, exp. inspection, fictitious info to officer (usually incorrect name), parking in a handicapped space (usually parking tickets don't count, but this one does), failure to notify DMV of an address change, window tint, city ordinance violations

## Alternatives to moving violation conviction
### Dismissal or acquittal
* Acquittal (unlikely)
* Outright dismissal of a moving violation (rare)
* Dismissal of non-moving violation

### Reduce or Amend to Non-Moving Violation
* Speeding --> Improper equipment (not available if speed > 25 over)

### Prayer for Judgment Continued (PJC)
* Unique to NC
