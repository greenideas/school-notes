        <outline text="Notice" _note="- Tulk v. Moxhay - Created the equitable servitude&#8212;a new interest in property. Ct said it was inequitable to buy land at a lower price by agreeing to restrict its use, and then to sell it at a higher price to someone who wasn't bound by the covenant. Thus ESs replace the privity requirement with a *notice* requirement.

- Abandonment
     - If a covenant is in an early plan but not later versions, it is presumed to be abandoned.
   - If the owners consistently violate the covenants such that no general plan is apparent, a court might terminate all covenants
- Changed circumstances - A covenant may terminate when it no longer serves the purpose for which it was enacted
     - People arguing that a covenant shd terminate due to changed circumstances can't be the ones who changed them.">
