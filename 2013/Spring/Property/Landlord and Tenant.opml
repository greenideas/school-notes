        <outline text="Term of Years" _note="* Term must be identified, and start and end dates must be given.
* Alienable, devisable, &amp; heritable unless a covenant states otherwise
* If the lessor dies, her estate has to honor the lease
* Termination of the lease at the end of the term is self-executing">

        <outline text="Periodic Tenancy" _note="* Has no defined end date (day-to-day, month-to-month, etc)
* a party has to give notice to end a periodic lease
* Can be created implicitly at the end of a term of years lease, if the tenant keeps paying rent on schedule and the landlord keeps accepting it.">
        </outline>
        <outline text="Tenancy at Will" _note="* CL: Terminates whenever either party wishes with no notice required
    * Modern: states may require notice and only allow tenant to terminate the lease

          <outline text="Holdover as renewal of lease" _note="* States may treat as renewing the lease

      <outline text="Landlord's Duty" _note="* &quot;English Rule&quot; (majority) - Lessor has to deliver actual possession, ousting any holdover tenant.
* &quot;American Rule&quot; - Lessor only has to deliver legal possession">
      </outline>
      <outline text="Transfers" _note="* Privity of K (old rule) - Only parties to K could go after each other in court
* Privity of estate - Obligations run with the land, and landlord may go after tenant's assignee for rent.
* Rule of intent (minority rule) - look to the whole instrument to see if conveyance was intended to be a sublease or an assignment.">
        <outline text="Assignment" _note="* Tenant transfers his full interest to the assignee for the rest of the lease's term
* Privity of estate exists between landlord and tenant' assignee
* Assignee is primarily liable to landlord, but tenant/assignor is secondarily liable as a surety.">

        <outline text="Sublease" _note="* Tenant transfers some part of the lease shorter than the remainder of the term
* Original lessee retains an interest in the lease property
* Creates a brand new landlord-tenant relationship b/w sublessor and subtenant.
* Privity of estate does **NOT** exist b/w landlord and subtenant">

* DEF Servient estate - Estate burdened by the easement (the one with the right-of-way on it)
* DEF Dominant estate - Estate that benefits from the easement
    * After the easement is created, the dominant estate can't be enlarged such that the larger estate would be burdened.
* DEF Affirmative easement - an easement for a particular purpose, e.g. For parking
* DEF Negative easement - an easement preventing landowner from doing something, e.g. Parking too close to the road, growing bushes past a certain height
    * Every affirmative easement implies a negative one">
