### Jackson ###

* Will: O ->N, A & K as joint tenants
* Deed: N -> A (Quit claim)
* Will: A -> Jackson et al.
* O -> A and B & heirs
	* As joint tenants w/ rt of survivorship

### Real Estate Financing ###

* Mortgagor == Borrower
* Mortgagee == Lender
* Deed of Trust == Mortgage
* Promissory Note, so banks can recoup the full outstanding amount of the loan if the security (i.e. the house) doesn't sell for enough to cover the loan

### Mortgages ###

* Title theory
	* Granting of a mortgage turns joint tenancy into tenancy in common
* Lien theory

* Constructive trust
	* title to property has gotten into the wrong hands
	* Wife killed husband & has title by right of survivorship
	* Pretend she is the trustee of the property, holding it for the benefit of herself and her husband's estate in fee simple
* USDA - (simultaneous death act) Both joint tenants die at the same time
	* 120 hours is the limit on simultaneity. If couple dies <120 hours apart, their joint tenancy is split in two. If its >120 hours, survivor gets full title.
* Foreclosure actions are intended to be slow b/c we want to give ppl the ability to stay in their houses
