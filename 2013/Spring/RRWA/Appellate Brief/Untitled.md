## Cases ##

* *Brenneman v. MedCentral Health Sys.*, 366 F.3d 412 (6th Cir. 2004) 
	* **Test for sufficiency of notice** "the critical test for substantively-sufficient notice is whether the information that the employee conveyed to the employer was reasonably adequate to apprise the employer of the employee's request to take leave for a serious health condition that rendered him unable to perform his job." *Brenneman* at 421.
	* Argue π's notice wasn't sufficient to inform ∆ that she would be unable to perform her job.
	* Argue that π wasn't receiving "continuing treatment by a health care provider."
* *Walton v. Ford Motor Co.*, 424 F.3d 481 (6th Cir. 2005)
	* Notice was insufficient because it didn't include any medical evidence to support his claim & neither did π in the present case.
* *Brohm v. JH Properties, Inc.*, 149 F.3d 517 (6th Cir. 1998). 
	* "Brohm was not an “eligible employee” at the time he received medical attention for his condition. He had already been terminated a week earlier." *Brohm* at 523.
	* No treatment until after termination
	* π's indication of intent to get treatment is insufficient to establish eligibility.
* *O'Connor v. Busch's Inc.*, 07-11090, 2008 WL 3913688 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 19, 2008)
	* Compare fact pattern showing vague complaints to be insufficient notice.
	* Also the fact that π returned to work after bereavement leave might map to O'Connor's coming back to work after he twisted his knee.
