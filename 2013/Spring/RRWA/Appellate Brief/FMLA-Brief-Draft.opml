<outline text="Statement of the case" _note=""><outline text="Background: Park cost lives &amp; money" _note="* Drummond Bioprocesses researches medicine for illnesses that often attack patients who are already sick with cystic fibrosis. &#10;* It was in the middle of an important clinical trial of one of these treatments that Ms. Park's personal problems caused her to effectively abandon her team at the laboratory setting the trial back an entire year at a great cost &#10;    * both in terms of taxpayer dollars &#10;    * and life and quality of life for the patients sick with diseases Ms. Park was supposed to be helping to treat.&#10;"></outline>
<outline text="She knew when she came back that she was having trouble" _note="By the time Ms. Park came back from her bereavement leave, the team had been stretched thin from having had all hands on deck in her absence. Immediately after her return, Ms. Park claims she had trouble concentrating on even the minor tasks she was performing during the first three days. She admits even then while on light duty that she was unsure if she would be able to keep working.&#10;"></outline>
<outline text="She had many opportunities to give notice but didn't" _note="* At that point, did she communicate with her supervisor or anyone else to let them know she was having trouble so they could start figuring out a plan for staffing? She did not. &#10;* When she resumed her normal duties at the start of the following week, and she had an even harder time, did she tell anyone? No, she did not. &#10;*Did she tell anyone the next day after she failed to get any sleep the night before? No, she did not. &#10;*What she did instead was wait until after close of business on the last day she intended to work and send an email to let her supervisor know she wasn't going to be coming in for a few weeks starting the very next day. &#10;* And because she did it in an email, nobody was likely to or indeed did see it until the next day.&#10;"></outline>
<outline text="&quot;I understand&quot; you're having a hard time--not that you have a serious medical problem" _note="Her supervisor, Dr. emerson told her he understood. Given the tragedy in Ms. Park's family, of course her supervisor understood that she was having a hard time. When he replied to her email, he told her he understood what she was going through. And then he did what any compassionate person would do, which is to make sure she had someone to talk to. And he asked her to check back in with him so he would know how she was doing.&#10;"></outline>
<outline text="No follow up at all; trial was ruined" _note="But she didn't check in. She didn't check in at all in the 5 days between her last email to her supervisor and her Dr's appointment. And when three days had gone by after that appointment, and Ms. Park still hadn't made any effort to update her supervisor, with the trial already ruined, Drummond had to let her go.&#10;"></outline>

<outline text="Questions Presented" _note=""><outline text="QP1: When Ms. Park instructed her supervisor that she was taking &quot;a few more weeks&quot; off, would a reasonable employer take that as an indication of a serious medical condition?" _note=""></outline>
<outline text="QP2: Was less than 24 hours notice sufficient for a request for unforeseeable FMLA leave related to a condition that had persisted for weeks?" _note=""></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Argument: Park did not provide adequate notice of her intent to take FMLA-qualifying leave. It was inadequate in content and in its timing." _note=""><outline text="Content: Park's email to Desmond was not adequate to notify him of her intent to take FMLA leave." _note=""><outline text="Park's notice was not sufficient to make a reasonable employer understand that she had a serious health condition" _note=""><outline text="Brenneman: test for sufficiency of notice--was it reasonably adequate such that employer would know the employee had a serious health condition" _note="* &quot;the critical test for substantively-sufficient notice is whether the information that the employee conveyed to the employer was reasonably adequate to apprise the employer of the employee's request to take leave for a serious health condition that rendered him unable to perform his job.&quot;&#10;"><outline text="Define &quot;Serious health condition&quot; § 825.113 (a)" _note="* &quot;For purposes of FMLA, 'serious health condition' entitling an employee to FMLA leave means an illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental condition that involves inpatient care as defined in § 825.114 or continuing treatment by a health care provider as defined in § 825.115&quot;&#10;"></outline>

<outline text="Hammon" _note="* Pilot developed an anxiety disorder. He had multiple conversations with his supervisor in which he complained of his symptoms &amp; that he was considering resigning since he felt like he could no longer do the job. The supervisor told him to take a couple of days off to get his confidence back. *Hammon* at 451.&#10;    * The 6th circuit ct. app. did not think that conversation contained enough information for the employer-defendant to reasonably conclude that employee-plaintiff's obvious emotional trouble constituted a serious medical condition.&#10;    * The only real difference between that scenario &amp; Park's is that Park mentioned that she planned to see a doctor. However, that by itself can be interpreted in a number of ways.&#10;    * O'Connor v. Busch shows that courts in this circuit applying Brenneman and Walton don't think that stating intent to see a doctor is sufficient to turn a request for time off to notice of a serious medical condition.&#10;"></outline>
</outline>
<outline text="ALTERNATIVE: Park did not meet her obligation to provide certification of her condition at her employer's request." _note=""><outline text="Assume Park gave notice of her serious heath condition" _note="* Emerson asked if Park had been to see a Dr. and told her to keep him posted.&#10;"></outline>
</outline>
</outline>
<outline text="Timing: &lt;24 hours notice was inadequate for a condition that had been ongoing for weeks." _note=""><outline text="Standard: &quot;As soon as practicable,&quot; 29 C.F.R. § 825.303(a)" _note="* The notice Park actually gave was less than 24 hours&#10;* She was back at work for four days before leaving again, the last two of which involved the kind of work she claimed to be unable to perform.&#10; * When Park came back after her bereavement leave, she already had trouble concentrating despite the fact that the work she was doing at that point wasn't very hard. She should have known at that point that she would've been unable to do the much more demanding work that would be starting back up the following week.&#10;  * If she had found after the first Monday back, or even the following morning (since she claims that insomnia was part of the problem), that she couldn't work, that may have been enough time to let Callie Greene know she would have to work an additional shift or to come up with another staffing solution.&#10;"></outline>
<outline text="Cavin: “[w]hat is practicable, both in terms of the timing of the notice and its content, will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case.”" _note="* The plaintiff in Cavin, was injured in a motorcycle accident. In that case, same-day notice was adequate given the acute nature of the injury.&#10;* In this case, the &quot;injury&quot; happened weeks before she gave notice&#10;"></outline>

<outline text="Conclusion" _note=""><outline text="Park's notice was not sufficient to entitle her to FMLA leave." _note=""><outline text="It was not adequate to make her employer think she had a serious health condition" _note=""></outline>
<outline text="Even if it was adequate with regard to its content, the timing of the notice was not practicable" _note=""><outline text="As a result, taxpayer money was wasted and very sick people were denied treatments that could have lengthened and improved their lives." _note=""></outline>
