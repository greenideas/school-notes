\
Ms. Park's notice was not sufficient to entitle her to FMLA leave. It was not adequate to make her employer think she had a serious health condition. Even if it was adequate with regard to its content, the timing of the notice was not practicable. As a result, taxpayer money was wasted and very sick people were denied treatments that could have lengthened and improved their lives. While the tragedy she suffered was undeniably horrific, it does not absolve her of her responsibility to her employer, or to the people her work could have helped. \

Since Ms. Park has again failed to prove she gave notice of her intent to take FMLA leave, Drummond requests that the Court affirm the below grant of summary judgment.}
