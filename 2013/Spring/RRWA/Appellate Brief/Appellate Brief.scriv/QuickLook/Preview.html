<p class="binderItem"><strong>Statement of the Case</strong><br/># Statement of the Case #<br/>
<br/>
Ms. Park alleges that Drummond Bioprocesses, Inc. ("Drummond") interfered with her right to take medical leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). She contends her communication with her supervisor was sufficient to notify Drummond of her intent to take such leave. Ms. Park further contends that her supervisor's response to her communication amounted to a grant of FMLA leave.<br/>

The district court agreed with Drummond that Ms. Park failed to prove that she gave no...</p>

 <br/>
Ms. Park was a senior lab technician at Drummond Bioprocesses, and a valued member of their research staff. R. at 8. Drummond researches medicines for illnesses that often attack patients who are already sick with cystic fibrosis. *Id.* at 7. It was at a crucial moment in an important clinical trial of one of these treatments that Ms. Park stopped coming to work. R. at 14; *see also* R. at 10 (on the importance of the stage of the trial). In so doing, she set the trial b...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong># Summary of the Argument #<br/>
<br/>
Drummond contends that Ms. Park's communication was insufficient in content and inadequately timed, and so did not constitute valid notice of intent to take FMLA leave. Because of this, the district court's grant of summary judgment should be affirmed.<br/>
<br/>
An employer only has the burden to gather information on whether an employee's request for time off qualifies for FMLA leave when that request would make a reasonable employer think the employee had a serious medical condition. *Brenneman v. MedCentral Health Sys.*, 366 F.3d 412, 421 (6th Cir. 2004). The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has said that an employee who communicates severe, debilitating psychological symptoms to her employer has not necessarily given notice of a serious medical condition, even when she has said that those symptoms prevent her from doing her job. *Hammon v. DHL Airways, Inc.*, 165 F.3d 441, 450 (6th Cir. 1999). Given the direct applicability of this standard to the present case, this Court should find that Ms. Park's communication with her supervisor was not sufficient to trigger a duty to get more information about her FMLA status.<br/>
<br/>
Not only was Ms. Park's notice insufficient in its content, but it was also inadequately timed to allow her to qualify for FMLA leave. The regulatory standard for timing is that notice must be "as soon as practicable." 29 C.F.R. ยง 825.303 (2009). Since Ms. Park's condition was non-acute, and since she knew even before returning to work that she might be unable to do her job, last minute notice was not practicable. Further, examining the Department of Labor's intent in drafting that regulation shows that behavior like Ms. Park's was precisely what it was meant to prohibit.<br/>
<br/>
Since Ms. Park's email to her supervisor did not indicate that she had a serious medical condition, and because that email was not adequately timed, she did not give sufficient notice of her intent to take FMLA-qualifying leave. Thus, this Court should affirm the below grant of summary judgment.</strong><br/># Summary of the Argument #<br/>

## Because Ms. Park's Notice of Her Intent to Take FMLA-Qualifying Leave Was Both Insufficient in its Content and Inadequately Timed, This Court Should Affirm the Below Grant of Summary Judgement ##<br/>

### The Content of Park's Email to Desmond Was Not Sufficient to Make a Reasonable Employer Understand That She Had a Serious Health Condition and Was Therefore Not Adequate to Create a Duty to Seek Further Information. ###<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong># Statement of Facts #</strong><br/># Conclusion #<br/>
<br/>
Ms. Park's notice was not sufficient to entitle her to FMLA leave. It was not adequate to make her employer think she had a serious health condition. Even if it was adequate with regard to its content, the timing of the notice was not practicable. As a result, taxpayer money was wasted and very sick people were denied treatments that could have lengthened and improved their lives. While the tragedy she suffered was undeniably horrific, it does not absolve her of her responsibilit...</p>
