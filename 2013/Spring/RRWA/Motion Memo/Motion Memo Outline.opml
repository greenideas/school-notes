I told Mr. Paulson that from that date forward, any failure by him to strictly comply with the Dracon Sick Leave Policy could result in termination of his employment. In particular, I informed him that: (1) he was required to call me by 9:00 AM on any day he would be calling in sick; and (2) on any sick day, he would be permitted to leave his home only for reasons incidental to his illness. I told him he was required to notify me when leaving and returning home on sick days and that a Sick Investigator may visit his home on sick days.&quot; Miceli aff. 10&#10;&#10;Multiple subsequent violations.

He claims the first day of which was to care for his daughter, but that his supervisor told him not to come back to work until he had a signed medical certification form. Since he didn't get the form until two weeks later, he didn't come back in. ∂ denies such a conversation occurred &amp; that π only called once during his whole absence. π had previously been tardy &amp; absent.&#10;&#10;π proved the elements of his FMLA claim, but ∂ also proved that they would've fired him anyway."/>

      <outline text="Summary">
        <outline text="The only element in dispute is whether π was denied benefits to which he was entitled under FMLA. Since under Edgar, he wasn't so entitled if ∂ had a legitimate reason, unrelated to his FMLA claim, and under Adams absenteeism is such a reason, ∂ is not in violation. Further, for the purposes of summary judgment, Donald (see also Jaszczyszyn) held that McDonnell Doulgas burden shifting applies when when a &quot;legitimate, unrelated reason&quot; is given for the termination. π's only real evidence, which is temporal proximity, is insufficient to get past summary judgment, after Jaszczyszyn (see also Skrjanc)."/>
