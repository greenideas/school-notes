<p class="binderItem"><strong>Preliminary Statement</strong><br/>Brief Introduction<br/>
<br/>
Torsten Paulson (“Plaintiff”) is suing pursuant to the Family Medical Leave Act regarding his termination by Dracon Publishing, Inc. (“Dracon”). Since the undisputed facts as Plaintiff alleges them establish that he was fired for cause, and that his termination was lawful under that Act, Dracon is seeking summary judgment in the matter.</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Statement of the case</strong><br/>Statement of Facts<br/>
<br/>
Dracon Publishing employed Plaintiff for more than four years, beginning in 2008. During that time, Plaintiff developed a worsening pattern of absenteeism and failure to comply with the company’s policy regarding sick days. Miceli Aff. ¶¶ 7-9. In 2010, Plaintiff repeatedly failed to meet Dracon’s absence reporting requirements. Miceli Aff. ¶ 9, Dec. 7, 2012. In 2011, not only did Plaintiff continue to fail to meet his reporting obligations (Micelli Aff. ¶ 9), but his twenty-t...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>SJ Explanation</strong><br/>Summary judgment is proper “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The substantive law identifies which facts are material, and only a dispute “over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). Moreover, a dispute over facts is genuine on...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>No Entitlement under Edgar</strong><br/>II. There is no Issue of Material Fact Concerning Dracon's Legitimate Reason for Terminating Plaintiff’s Employment<br/>
<br/>
To prevail in a FMLA interference suit, the employee must prove the elements of the alleged interference. In the present case, the only element in dispute is the final one, namely that “the employer denied the employee FMLA benefits to which []he was entitled.” Edgar v. JAC Products, Inc., 443 F.3d 501, 507 (6th Cir. 2006). The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, when considering whet...</p>

<br/>
When an employer has proven it had a legitimate reason for terminating an employee claiming interference with FMLA rights, the burden is on the employee to show that the reason “had no basis in fact, did not motivate the termination, or was insufficient to warrant the termination.” Donald v. Sybra, Inc., 667 F.3d 757, 762 (6th Cir. 2012). Thus, the plaintiff cannot meet the burden of proo...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>The Court Should Grant Summary Judgment in this Case</strong><br/>I. The Court Should Grant Dracon Summary Judgment in this Case<br/>
<br/>
Given the undisputed facts on record, and previous reasoning within the Sixth Circuit, this Court should grant summary judgment in favor of Dracon. The only element of Plaintiff’s claim that is in dispute is whether he was denied benefits to which he was entitled under the Family Medical Leave Act. Plaintiff has failed to show that he was so entitled. Dracon had no other option than to terminate Plaintiff’s employment after his want...</p>
