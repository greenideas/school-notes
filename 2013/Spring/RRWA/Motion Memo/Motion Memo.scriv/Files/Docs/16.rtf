\f0\fs28 \cf0 6th Cir. 2012\
\
\uc0\u960  was absent from work for just under two weeks. He claims the first day of which was to care for his daughter, but that his supervisor told him not to come back to work until he had a signed medical certification form. Since he didn't get the form until two weeks later, he didn't come back in. \u8706  denies such a conversation occurred & that \u960  only called once during his whole absence. \u960  had previously been tardy & absent.\
\
\uc0\u960 \'a0proved the elements of his FMLA claim, but \u8706  also proved that they would've fired him anyway.}
