\f0\fs28 \cf0 I. The Court Should Grant Dracon Summary Judgment in this Case
\i \
\

\i0 Given the undisputed facts on record, and previous reasoning within the Sixth Circuit, this Court should grant summary judgment in favor of Dracon. The only element of Plaintiff\'92s claim that is in dispute is whether he was denied benefits to which he was entitled under the Family Medical Leave Act. Plaintiff has failed to show that he was so entitled. Dracon had no other option than to terminate Plaintiff\'92s employment after his wanton disregard for the company\'92s policy and for his responsibilities to his coworkers and his employer. Since the reasons Dracon has given for terminating Plaintiff: 1) have a clear base in the undisputed factual record; 2) were sufficient to warrant the termination; and 3) actually did motivate the termination; the Court should grant Dracon summary judgment.}
