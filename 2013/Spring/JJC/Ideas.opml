      <outline text="Length of time &lt;--&gt; inevitability" _note="Does this give more process or less? Does it mean police can run out the clock on an investigation to constitutionally launder their illegal searches?
Or does it ensure that police do the good faith work of pursuing untainted connections b/w the info from the illegal search and the evidence the gov't wants to introduce?">

      <outline text="Gov't didn't prove inevitability" _note="Just like in Fofana, the gov't failed to introduce evidence that could've showed inevitability. Is there a policy argument to be made that we want to incentivize putting the best evidence forward in every case?">

      <outline text="Is TSA an administrative or law enforcement agency? Does it matter?">

      <outline text="When may illegally obtained evidence be used to tie a suspect to an alias? Is an alias &quot;part and parcel&quot; of a suspect's identity?">
      </outline>
      <outline text="Is a consequence of this narrowing that the right will stop applying to states (no longer implicit in the concept of ordered liberty)? It would be hard to make the case that a right so systematically eroded is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.">
      </outline>
      <outline text="Is there an incentive for prosecutors to overcharge in order to have some charges to drop (i.e. the passport) to sacrifice at the altar of deterrence.">
