# Hamdi v. Rumsfeld

* **Year:** 2004
* **Deciding Judge:** SOC, joined by Rehnquist, Kennedy & Breyer
* **Page in Casebook:** 382-393

## Parties

* **π/appellant/petitioner:** 
* **∆/appellee**

## Facts

*  π is a US citizen, born in LA, captured in Afghanistan.

## Procedural History

* Gov't alleges π was fighting with the Taliban
* π was taken to Guantanamo before they realized he was a US citizen & brought him back into the States
* 4th circuit ct. app. said π's detention was legal & that he wasn't entitled to any opportunity to challenge his status as an enemy combatant

## Relevant Law ##

* Congressional resolution giving POTUS auth to:
	* Use necessary & appropriate force against any ppl, orgs, or countries he thinks were involved in 9/11
		* Or who harbored such ppl.
* 18 USC § 4001(a)
	* No citizen shall be detained by the US except with congressional auth
	* § 4001(a) was passed to limit executive authority to detain in order to prevent another WWII internment camp situation


## Issue

* Can a US citizen captured abroad as an enemy combatant be detained indefinitely & w/o due process?

## Parties' Arguments ##

### Π ###

* § 4001(a) prohibits his detention
* AUMF doesn't permit indefinite detention
* "[E]xtra-judicial detention [that] begins and ends with the submission of an affidavit based on third-hand hearsay" does not comport with 5A & 14A
	* Individual can't be held by the executive w/o recourse to a tribunal to determine warrant of executive's claim against him

### ∆ ###

* No explicit congressional auth to detain enemy combatants is necessary
	* § 4001(a) only applies to civilian detainees.
	* π *is* being detained subject to congressional auth--namely the authorization of force.
* Giving π more process than he got would be "constitutionally intolerable"
	* π was captured on foreign soil, so no right to habeas since detention can be ruled on as a matter of law with no add'l fact-finding
	* More fact-finding would violate the constitution (separation of powers).
		* Cts should defer to military judgment in times of war
		* Only determine constitutionality of detention scheme as a whole rather than the status of a particular detainee.
			* But if cts insist on process for individuals, it should use a "some evidence" standard

## Reasoning

* "enemy combatant" = "part of forces hostile to US or its coalition partners"

### AUMF Is Sufficient to Meet § 4001(a)'S "Act of Congress Requirement" ###

* Taliban are exactly who congress meant to target with AUMF
* Detention of Taliban fighters is "necessary & appropriate force"
	* Detention is part of war & prevents combatants from returning to the front
	* Detention for the duration of the conflict is still necessary & appropriate (but not indefinite detention)
	* Distinguish *Ex parte Milligan* where Milligan was arrested in Indiana--not on a confederate battlfield

### Persons Designated "Enemy Combatants" Who File Habeas Motions Are Entitled to an Impartial Hearing to Adjudicate the Factual Basis for That Designation. ###

#### Habeas ####

* Gov't didn't allege sufficient facts to support its claim that π was an enemy combatant
	* Parties agree everyone detained in the US is entitled to a habeas writ unless Congress explicitly suspends that right
	* π hasn't been allowed to speak for himself, so ∆ can't say the facts of π's detention are undisputed.
	* And the facts as alleged by ∆ don't even support π's detention
		* Habeas petition just said that π resided in Afghanistan which is a long way off from being captured in a zone of combat operations
* Tension b/w gov't interest in autonomy in order to efficiently pursue important goals and an individual's constitutional right to due process
	* *Mathews v. Eldridge*: Right to due process has to be weighed against gov't interest and the burden on the gov't of providing greater process
		* Analyzed by evaluating the risk of "erroneous deprivation" of the right and the "probable value…of additional…safeguards"
		* Strong interests on both sides
			* *π's interest in being free from detention* 
				* π's interest is the fundamental interest in being free from detention by one's own government--even in the case of treason
					* High risk of erroneous detention w/o due process
					* Putting machinery in-place for "no process" detention of combatants creates a risk for that machinery to be employed against people who pose no such threat.
			* *Gov'ts interests in prosecuting a war*
				* Gov't has an interest in keeping combatants from returning to the front
				* Militaries engaged in combat don't have the time or infrastructure to give due process.
		* But it's when circumstances are the most dire that it's most important to uphold our constitutional values
		* Therefore, a citizen being detained as an enemy combatant must:
			1. Receive notice of the factual basis for that designation
			2. Have an opportunity to challenge those factual assertions in front of an impartial decision maker

#### Due Process ####

* But some due process requirements may be suspended or loosened in order to accommodate the exigencies of combat:
	* Hearsay may admissible
	* Presumption in favor of gov't as long as the presumption was rebuttable
* Separation of powers is not violated by asserting due process must apply when the executive detains citizens, even under emergent circumstances
	* The requirement supports separation of powers by preventing impermissible consolidation of power within the executive.
* ∆'s proposed "some evidence" standard is thus inadequate
* Executive's facts have to be challenged.


## Holding

* Lower decision vacated & remanded:
	* 5-4: π can be detained as an enemy combatant
	* 8-1: π must be given due process

## Rule

* A US citizen held as an enemy combatant is entitled to a hearing on the factual basis of that designation.
 
## Dissent/Concurrence

### Souter (Concur/Dissent) ###

* with Ginsburg
* **Even if π is correctly designated an "enemy combatant," his detention is not authorized under § 4001(a) by AUMF**
	* AUMF doesn't explicitly grant authority to detain individuals & we have to read § 4001(a) as requiring such an explicit grant
		* Circumstances of § 4001(a)'s drafting require this reading
			* Point of the law was to keep gov't from detaining people without clear congressional authorization.
		* There is a balance b/w security & liberty, and we can't let the branch of government that's responsible for ensuring security also be the one to determine the correct balance against the liberty interest.

### Scalia (Dissent) ###

* With Stevens
* Tradition is to prosecute citizens accused of waging war on the US for treason.
	* Unless congress suspends that requirement (Art I § 9 cl. 2), which the AUMF doesn't do.
* So is there some separate, special crime of "aiding the enemy in wartime" with which π should've been charged?
	* When *citizens* who aid the enemy in wartime are captured, they should be prosecuted as traitors.
	* The Suspension Clause is the built-in workaround for when the criminal process won't work because of wartime conditions
	* If Congress determines that emergent circumstances should require suspension of due process, they can do that, but they have to actually pass a law to do it.
		* This transparency/accountability is essential when civil rights are being suspended.

### Thomas (Dissent)

* π is an enemy combatant and the fed. gov't has the authority to detain him under its war powers.
* Plurality got the balance of liberty v. security wrong

## Notes

* π was let go after giving up US citizenship, promising not to attack US & to never come back.
