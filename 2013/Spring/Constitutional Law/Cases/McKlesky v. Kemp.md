# McClesky v. Kemp
* SCOTUS, 1987, j. Powell

* **Parties**
	* π: McClesky
	* ∂: Kemp

* **Facts**
	* McClesky (a black man) convicted of 2x armed robbery and 1x murder in Superior Ct of Fulton County, GA
	* Robbed a furniture store & killed a white police officer in the course of the robbery
	* Had 3 accomplices. Everyone was armed.
	* McK went in front, other 3 in back.
	* McK made all of the customers lay face down on the floor
	* Other 3 bound the employees with tape
	* Store mgr was held at gunpoint & made to give over store receipts, his watch and $6.
	* The policeman, answering a silent alarm, came in the front door & started walking down the store's center aisle.
	* He was shot twice and was killed.
	* McK arrested 2 wks later for an unrelated offense and confessed his participation in the robbery but denied shooting the cop.
	* At least one of the bullets that hit the cop were fired from a gun that matched the description of McK's gun.
	* 2 witnesses said they heard McK confess to the killing.

* **Procedural History**
	* Trial ct convicted McK of murder.
	* GA needs aggravating circumstances in murder for for DP & there were 2 here: 1) murder during armed robbery & 2) murder of a police officer in the line of duty
	* jury considered aggravating and mitigating circumstances, though McK offered none of the latter.
	* Jury gave DP on the murder & consecutive life sentences on the 2x robbery
	* Court gave McK DP
	* McK appealed conviction & failed.
	* Filed habeas petition in Fed District Ct in N Dist. of GA.
	* One of his 18 claims was that GA gave DPs in a racially discriminatory manner (8th & 14th amendments).
	* Introduced as evidence a study showing GA's disparities in DP based on the race of the victim & to a lesser extent on D's race:
		* 11% get DP with white victims, but only 1% get DP if the victim was black
		* 4% of black Ds get DP vs. 7% of white Ds
		* 22% get DP when D is black & victim is white; 8% when both D & victim are white; 1% when both D & victim are black; and 3% when D is white and victim is black
		* Prosecutors sought DP in 70% of trials where D was black & victim was white; 32% when both D & victim were white; 15% when both were black; and 19% when D was white and victim was black
		* Taking 39 nonracial variables into account, Ds who kill white people were 4.3x more likely to get DP
		* Black Ds 1.1x more likely to get DP

* **Issue**
	* Can statistical evidence of sentencing discrepancies be used to demonstrate equal protection violation?

* **Reasoning**
	* **II-A** - McK's claim that the court discriminated
		* Burden in equal protection cases is on D to prove purposeful discrimination and that the discrimination had a "discriminatory effect"
		* McK needed to show that there was discrimination *in his case*
		* If McK were right, every DP given to a black D who murder a white person would be discriminatory.
		* Two reasons why we can't use statistics here:
			1. Statistics can be used to show bias in jury selection based on bias in the district from where the jurors are drawn, but without that evidence we have to assume a fair jury.
			2. Statistics can only be used when the decisionmaker can tell the court why no bias exists, but since the decisionmakers here are jurors, that can't happen. (Jurors can't be called to testify why they voted how they did.)
		* Also, under US & GA law, McK's crime is one that may carry a death sentence (me: this is either question-begging or vacuous)
	* **II-B** - McK's claim that the state discriminated
		* McK claims the state violated the EPC because it knew of the discriminatory application of DP but kept the DP in place, but for this McK would have to show that GA kept the DP *because of* the disparity rather than in spite of it (*Rational basis scrutiny*)
	* **III** - McK's claim that the sentencing system discriminated
		* Discretion in sentencing isn't unconstitutional. A jury can use its discretion to not convict, to convict of a lesser offense, or to give a non-capital punishment.
		* Decisions that go against a D can be contested, but decisions that go for D are final.
	* **III-C**
		* Disparities in sentencing aren't sufficient to show systemic discrimination.
		* Unexplained != invidious
		* Considering the safeguards in place to prevent discriminatory sentencing as well as the benefits of discretion to Ds, the statistical study does not show excessive risk of racial bias.
		* Dissent says that discretion allows racial bias into trials:
			* No guidelines to rein in prosecutorial discretion
			* Juries don't have a list of aggravating factors or a way to balance them against each other.
		* But no such guidelines could be written that would apply from case to case but still be predictable (me: but if prosecutorial decisions aren't predictable now, what would we lose by attempting to create those guidelines?)
		* Reductio: We could end up applying this logic to discrepancies that aren't race-based (facial features of either the D or the victim--really anything that we can show with statistics)
		* McK's argument is best directed at legislators.
	  
* **Holding**
	* Evidence of racial disparity in sentencing does not constitute an Equal Protection violation
 
* **Dissent**
	*  JJ. Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun, Stevens
	* Brennan & Marshall: DP is given so arbitrarily that it should be abandoned altogether
	* All dissenters for the remainder below.
	* There's no way that, if McK had asked his lawyer what his chances were, that the answer would've been something to the effect that, since you're black and you killed a white cop, you're probably going to get the DP.
	* 4 reasons for majority opinion:
		1. Desirability of discretion
			* Discretion is there so the court can consider each D's circumstances & respect his autonomy & dignity
			* When race influences that discretion, this directly undermines that goal. If it looks like that discrimination is present, there should be a lower standard for determining if that is indeed the case.
		2. Safeguards against abuse of discretion [response omitted]
		3. Perils of broader challenges to fairness of sentencing
			* "[F]ear of too much justice" 
			* If there are other instances where discrepancies like this exist, why *wouldn't* we want to know about them and get rid of them?
			* Race is different from other characteristics. The court has gone to great lengths throughout its history in order to promote fairness in matters of race. Any racial bias is bad, and if it's in DP cases, it's especially bad.
			* Yes, no system of punishment will be perfect, but when the DP is at stake, we should hold the process to a higher standard.
			* The marginal benefit to the state of giving the DP vs LWOP is much less than the marginal loss to the defendant.
		4. Understanding the role of the judiciary [response omitted]
	* The Baldus study was so thorough that rejecting it sets too high a bar for subsequent studies.
