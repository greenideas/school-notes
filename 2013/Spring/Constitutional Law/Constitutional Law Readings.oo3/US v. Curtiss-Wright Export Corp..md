# US v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.

* **Deciding Judge:** Sutherland
* **Page in Casebook:** 370-373

## Parties

* **π/appellant/petitioner:** 
* **∆/appellee**

## Facts

*  

## Procedural History

* ∆ prosecuted for selling arms to Bolivia in violation of executive order
* 

## Relevant Law ##

* Congressional resolution authorized president to prevent sale of arms to nations involved in Chaco border dispute
* FDR's executive order to do that

## Issue

* Did the congressional resolution exceed the authority that congress may delegate to the president concerning foreign commerce?
* If, as applied to domestic policy, this delegation would be impermissible, would it nonetheless be permissible as a matter of foreign policy?

## Reasoning

* Differences b/w foreign & domestic policy
	* For matters of foreign policy, federal power is not limited to enumerated or implied powers under the constitution
		* With domestic matters, limited federal power is required since it vests only in the grant of authority from the states, & so non-enumerated powers must remain with the states.
		* The states never had powers of foreign relations
		* Thus federal foreign policy power is not limited to enumerated powers.
	* Excerise of foreign policy powers is limited to very few ppl
		* President is the only person who can act as a representative of the US & negotiate on behalf of US
		* Presidential auth for foreign policy comes from the constitution--not from congress
		* Letting congress limit POTUS's power to negotiate would be embarrassing
		* POTUS has consular officials & diplomats to give him info, so is better informed than congress

## Notes

* If framers didn't need to enumerate foreign policy powers then why did they?
