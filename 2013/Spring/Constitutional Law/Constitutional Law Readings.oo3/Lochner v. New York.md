# Lochner v. New York

* **Year:** 1905
* **Deciding Judge:** Peckham
* **Page in Casebook:** 608-613

## Relevant Law ##

* NY law prohibited bakers to work more than 60 hours/wk
* 14A freedom of K

## Issue

* 

## Reasoning

* States police power includes power to regulate health, safety, morals & general welfare
* If state uses police power to stop a K (e.g. an illegal or immoral K), that ad be okay under 14A.
* Tension is thus between individual's right to K & state's right to prevent the exercise of that right. 
* *Holden v. Hardy* upheld limits on miner hours, but mining is dangerous. So a valid exercise of police power.
* Limits on police power
	* Any time state uses police power, ask: 
		* is this a fair, reasonable, and appropriate use of the power or is it "unreasonable, unnecessary, and arbitrary interference" with individual liberty
		* Whether a use of police power is justified is up to the Court.
* No reasonable ground (rational basis?) for regulating bakers' hours.
* When state's power to regulate conflicts w/ individual liberty, the regulation has to be directly connected to a legitimate state interest.

## Holding

* NY law is an invalid use of police power

## Rule

* Freedom of K incorporates in 5A/14A.
 
## Dissents
### Holmes

* A constitution is not a vessel for an economic theory, be it central planning or laissez-faire
* Maj. misuses "liberty"
	* liberty can't encompass something that isn't a fundamental right (according to a "rational and fair man.")

### Harlan

* with White and Day
* freedom of K is still subject to regs on health, safety, morals & welfare.
* presumption against invalidating laws.
* it's hard out there for a baker.
* don't presume that NY acted in bad faith with this reg.
