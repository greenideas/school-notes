# Nebbia v. New York

* **Year:** 1934
* **Deciding Judge:** Roberts
* **Page in Casebook:** 622-623

## Relevant Law ##

* NY law setting price min & max for milk.

## Issue

* Does the constitution allow a state to set the price of milk
* Does 14A prohibit state/local interference with private business?

## Reasoning

* State was regulating the price of milk in order to protect dairy farmers as well as public health. 
* General rule is that use of property & making of Ks is not up to the gov't, but there are limits to property rights and freedom of K.
	* Public interest can limit private liberty
* Limits were fair to producer & consumer and served a legitimate purpose.

## Rule

* An economic regulation whose means are reasonably related to a legitimate purpose is constitutional under 14A.
