## Parties

* **π/appellant/petitioner:** 
* **∆/appellee**

## Facts

*  LA legislature gave ∆ a monopoly on butchering

## Procedural History

* π sued to challenge the grant of the monopoly
	* Created involuntary servitude (13A)
	* Deprived them of property (5A)
	* Denied them equal protection (14A)
	* Abridged P&I (14A)

## Relevant Law ##


## Issue

* 

## Reasoning

* State legislatures can decide where butchering happens.
* Statute was appropriate for that goal.
* 13A
	* 13A came out of the Civil War & Emancipation Proclamation
	* But involuntary servitude means more than chattel slavery.
	* Long apprenticeships, serfdom, etc.
* 14A
	* State implementations of emancipation still left blacks without many of the rights of citizens.
	* Protection against slavery has to apply to more than just former chattel slaves.
	* P&I clause doesn't say anything about citizens of a State.
	* Art IV § 2 says each state's citizen get the Ps & Is of the citizens of the several states.
		* But the particular Ps & Is are the fundamental ones that belong to all citizens of free countries.
		* Purpose of Congress in creating 14A wasn't to subjugate state power
	* Due Process
		* No way to interpret DP as saying that these butchers are being deprived of property
	* Equal Protection
		* EP Clause is meant to protect former slaves.
		* Doesn't apply otherwise. 

## Holding

* P&I doesn't extend 13A & 5A rights to bar state actions
 
## Dissent

* Field, dissenting 
* 14A creates rights of citizens of the US that don't depend on citizenship of a particular state.
* Thus rights given by the US Constitution can't be abridged by the states.

## Notes

* Narrow interp. of DP only lasted until the end of the 19th C.
* Narrow interp. of EP lasted well into the 20th C.
