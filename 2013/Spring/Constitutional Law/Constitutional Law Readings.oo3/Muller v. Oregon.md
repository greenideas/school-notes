## Relevant Law ##

* OR law limited the number of hours/day a woman could work in a laundry.

## Parties' Arguments ##

### âˆ† ###

* Brandeis presented research showing that it could be dangerous to women's health for them to work excessive hours 
 
## Reasoning

* As the Brandeis Brief shows, women are delicate 
* Women make & raise our babies, so we need to keep them safe
* This is an adequate basis for treating women differently from men under the law.

## Holding

* Women may be treated differently under the law as a valid use of police power to protect the general welfare. LOL.
