# Authority #

## Out of State Authority ##
### Persuasive Authority ###

* Tarasoff (CA): Therapist has duty to protect (warn?) 3rd party if a reasonable practitioner would foresee the risk.
* Boynton (FL): No duty to 3rd party

## NC Authority ##
### Persuasive ###
#### Pritchett v. Okun ####

* US Dist. ct.
* Under NC law, HIPAA, & Prof. conduct rules, Dr. *may* warn 3rd party
* Immunity from liability only applies to drs. in connection w/ the civil commitment process
* *Gregory*: Ct of App. said general negligence is the right theory to apply in failure to warn cases.
* *Currie v. USA, IBM* did *not* rule out a general duty to warn in NC.

#### Currie v. USA, IBM ####

* 4th Cir. Ct. App.
* Distinguishes "special relationship" from "right to control," but both still create duty
* Duty to warn vs. duty to seek commitment:
	* Duty to warn: 
		* "runs only to identifiable persons within a recognizable zone of danger"
		* Doesn't depend on power to control
	* Duty to seek commitment
		* Requires power to control
	* Policy:
		* Seeking commitment will let the patient know of therapist's involvement & impair the therapeutic relationship.
		* A warning isn't necessarily attributable to the clinician & doesn't affect liberty.
* Statute gives immunity to clinicians in hospitals who follow professional standards.
* By enacting that statute, NC wants to really limit liability for clinicians. 

### Binding ###

#### Stein v. A'ville BOE ####

* NC Sup. Ct.
* NC CL Rule for negligence:
	* To state a claim for common law negligence, a plaintiff must allege: 
		1. a legal duty;
		2. a breach thereof; and
		3. injury proximately caused by the breach.
			* Injury has to have been:
				* Foreseeable, and	
				* Avoidable through due care
* Generally no duty to prevent criminal acts of others, *but* relationship b/w ∆ and person causing the harm can create a duty.
	* No relationship b/w ∆ & 3rd person unless ∆:
		* knows or should know of 3rd person's violent propensities; **and**
		* has the ability and opportunity to control that 3rd person
			* So was Robert in ∆'s control while at school?
				* Yes:
					* School had policies about students leaving campus
					* ∆ was allowed to practice on campus
				* No: 
					* ∆ wasn't employed by the school

#### Gregory v. Kilbride ####

* NC Ct. App.
* No *Tarasoff* duty to warn--just a duty to exercise control with reasonable care to prevent harm to others.

### Persuasive ###

* To recover for negligence, π has to show:
	* Actionable duty
	* Breach
