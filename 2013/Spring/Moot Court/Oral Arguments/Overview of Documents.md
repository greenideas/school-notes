# Here is an overview of the case and attached are the documents.

## In a nutshell

This case is before the North Carolina Supreme Court.  The Court granted the appeal to hear arguments on one issue only: whether North Carolina recognizes a duty of care owed by a psychologist, the defendant, Dr. Catherine Becker, to warn a third person (the plaintiff, Theodore “Chip” Andrews) of a specific threat of harm made against him by one of Dr. Becker’s patients, Robert Benchley.  Dr. Becker doesn’t otherwise know Chip.  She learned of Robert’s threat against him during her outpatient therapy sessions with Robert. 


In short, this appeal asks whether North Carolina wants to join those jurisdictions that follow the California Supreme Court’s decision in Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California, imposing a duty in tort on mental health professionals to warn third persons of specific, concrete threats toward their health and safety, posed by the patients of these professionals, about which the therapist learns during otherwise confidential therapy sessions.  North Carolina is generally viewed as a jurisdiction that has not yet adopted a position on the matter. 

## The procedural posture below 

The lawsuit was brought by the plaintiff, Chip Andrews, an 11th-grade high school student at Breverton High School, located near Asheville, North Carolina.  It was brought against the defendant, Dr. Becker, a psychologist in private practice who regularly held therapy sessions with Robert Benchley, a former high-school teammate of Chip’s.  The Trial Court denied the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, let the case proceed to a bench trial, and then entered a final judgment, finding that North Carolina tort law does include a therapist’s duty to warn third persons under the factual circumstances of this case.  A copy of the Trial Court’s 3-page Order Denying Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss is appended as Attachment A.   

On appeal, the North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed in a 2-1 decision.  The Majority held that North Carolina does not follow Tarasoff; the Dissent argued that the question was open and that, in fact, on the circumstances of this case North Carolina should follow Tarasoff.  A copy of the Court of Appeals’ 4 ½-page opinion is appended as Attachment B. 

## The Moot Court Setting for the Argument ##

The students in this competition have been instructed that there are NO issues on appeal other than the existence (or not) of a duty in tort belonging to mental health professionals, other than those involved in the involuntary commitment setting, to warn third parties of specific threats of harm, posed by their mental-health patients, about which the professionals learn in the course of outpatient therapy sessions.  All students in this competition wrote a very short “argument” on only one side: representing Chip OPPOSING the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss.  On Monday and Tuesday, all students will similarly be representing Chip, but this time on the sole issue before the North Carolina Supreme Court on the existence (or not) of a Tarasoff duty in North Carolina.  On Wednesday, some of the remaining contestants will need to argue “off brief,” arguing against the existence of the duty.  The Final Round, between the remaining two contestants, will be at noon, in the Law School Courtroom, on Thursday, March 21.
