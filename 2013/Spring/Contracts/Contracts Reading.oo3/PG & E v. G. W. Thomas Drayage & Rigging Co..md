# PG & E v. G. W. Thomas Drayage & Rigging Co.

* **Year:** 1968
* **Deciding Judge:** Traynor
* **Court:** Sup Ct CA
* **Page in Casebook:** 494-497

## Facts

* ∆ Kd to replace the cover of π's steam turbine.
* ∆ agreed to perform the work at his own risk & expense & to indemnify π against loss, damage, injury, expense & liability from injury to property arising out of performance of K
* ∆ agreed to buy at least $50k insurance to cover liability for property damage.
* While ∆ was working, the cover fell off & damaged the turbine to the tune of $25k.

## Remedy Sought ##

* Damages for injury to property ($25k for the turbine rotor) under an indemnity clause of a K

## Procedural History

* Lower ct. found for π on the basis of the indemnity clause saying the clause didn't specify whose property it was to cover, so it covered π's.
	* Even though it was the kind of clause that is routinely used to indemnify 3rd party property, the trial ct said the plain language made it cover any property.
	* Ct. refused to admit any extrinsic evidence of other meaning than the "plain meaning"

## Issue

* Should evidence of the parties' intent in drafting an agreement be admitted in order to interpret the meaning of the terms of that agreement?

## Parties' Arguments ##

### ∆ ###

* ∆ gave evidence of admissions from π's agents & ∆'s behavior while performing similar Ks for π that the indemnity clause covered only 3rd party property.

## Reasoning

* Interpreting a K the way the trial court did depends on the judge's linguistic competence & a belief in "the possibility of perfect verbal expression"
* **Test for admissibility of extrinsic evidence: *is it relevant to prove a plausible meaning of the writing?***
	* Test is not whether the writing by itself is perfectly unambiguous
	* Such a test would ignore the intent of the parties & relies too heavily on the expressive capability of language.
	* Intent of the parties is what matters--not magic words
	* Words don't have constant referents, rather their meaning depends on context.
* Parol evidence can't be used to add, remove, or amend terms, but it can be used to determine what the terms are.
* If a party offers evidence of intent, it should be considered. Ct has to try to put itself in the parties' shoes.
* If the language of the K can reasonably be interpreted in multiple ways, parol evidence should be admitted.

## Holding

* Reversed.

## Rule

* If the language of the K can reasonably be interpreted in multiple ways, parol evidence should be admitted.
