# Trident Center v. Connecticut General Life Ins. Co.

* **Year:** 1988
* **Deciding Judge:** Kozinski
* **Court:** 9th Circ. Ct. App.
* **Page in Casebook:** 497-502

## Parties

* **π/appellant/petitioner:** Partnership b/w ins. co. & two big law firms.
* **∆/appellee:** Another ins. co.

## Facts

* π formed to build an office building.
* ∆ agreed to finance it.
* Parties negotiated a $56m business loan.
	* 12.25% / 15 years
	* No prepayment for years 1-12, prorated prepayment penalty for years 13-15
	* If π defaults in years 1-12, ∆ can make payment due with a 10% prepayment fee.
* A few years in, after interest rates fell, π wanted to refinance.
* ∆ refused since it had been <12 years.

## Procedural History

* π sued in order to pay the loan early plus the 10% prepayment fee.
* Dist. ct. said the K unambiguously forbade that, dismissed the suit, and (sua sponte) sanctioned π for filing a frivolous lawsuit.

## Issue

* Can a K ever be drafted that is immune to parol evidence?

## Parties' Arguments ##

### π ###

* π should be allowed to bring in parol evidence.
	* K is ambiguous & there's an interpretation that supports its interpretation.
	* CA law says parol evidence is admissible even when K seems unambiguous.

## Reasoning

* There is no reasonable interpretation of the text of the instrument that would allow π to prepay without default, and even then, only at ∆'s discretion.
	* π wants the court to let it default with no consequences, but defaults are supposed to have consequences.
* Traditional rule is that parol evidence is inadmissible when the instrument is unambiguous in its language.
* CA doesn't use the traditional rule, rather parol evidence is always admissible. *PG&E*
* *PG&E* rule creates a ton of uncertainty for CA business, but it's the rule.
* Given that, it's not π's fault for filing a dumb lawsuit that the CA justice system incented them to file, so no damages for a frivolous suit.

## Holding

* Reversed. 

## Rule

* No K can ever be drafted such that it is immune to parol evidence.
