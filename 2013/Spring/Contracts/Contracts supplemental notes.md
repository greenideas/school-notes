### Frigaliment
|  	|  Frigaliment (π)	| BNS (∆)|  
| ---- | ------	| ------	|  
| Claimed Understanding	| Broilers Only	| Stewers, broilers, etc.	|  
| Actual understanding	| Irrelevant!	| Stewers, broilers, etc.  

* Subjective understanding matches
* What Frigaliment actually intended to buy was irrelevant
	* If π's actual understanding was different from ∆'s:
		* No meeting of the minds
		* π has the burden to show that ct should accept their meaning, but hasn't met it
