# PR Class Notes
## August 28, 2013

* Before Ethics 2000, all L could disclose was info regarding future criminal acts that would result in death or SBH
* 1.6(a): L can't disclose info relating to representation unless:
	* C gives informed consent
	* Disclosure is part of representation
	* 1.6(b) exception applies
* 1.6 never *requires* disclosure. It's only permissive.
* Disclosure has to be the least info possible to achieve the purpose of the disclosure.
* Disclosure shouldn't cause someone to look for something they wouldn't otherwise look for, *even if that something is public record*

### Problem 3.3
* Ct. appointments are hard to decline.

* 4.1 is subservient to 1.6 since it **requires** disclosure.

## September 4, 2013
* Distinguish privilege from confidentiality:
    * Privilege has to be a convo with yr client w/ nobody else present (except and interpreter, etc.)
    * Confidentiality is a much broader concept & includes everything related to the representation
* Upjohn: convos are privileged, and if yr interlocutor is in the "control group" of an entity/corp
* Subject matter test: things observed at work & performing yr duties
* Nature of the convo vs identity of the person talking:
    * "control group" is over & underinclusive
    * If someone is talking to a lawyer seeking counsel, it should be privileged
    * When a lawyer approaches an employee to investigate something the emp'ee did to determine legal consequences, it's privileged.
* 1.2(d) buttresses 1.6 exceptions by requiring L not to aid C when you know C is doing something criminal or fraudulent
* "noisy withdrawal:" don't disclose C info, but make yr withdrawal known
* 4.1 c 3: sometimes L may have to disclose client info to show they didn't assist C's crime or fraud
* Start by advising C, then noisy withdrawal, then disclose as a last resort

## September 10, 2013
* In cases where you think you need to disclose something, you still have to think through the form the disclosure will take and to whom you will disclose
* 1.8(b) can't use info from rep to disadvantage C w/o C's informed consent
* Very easy to establish a L-C relationship

## September 11, 2013
* **1.2(a)** It's *always* up to the client whether to settle
* Washing machine hypo: competence requires L to investigate any possible defenses to the contract/collection.
* **Competence**: No L shd approach a task w/o knowledge of the ct rules, statutes & case law, esp. in an area L isn't intimately familiar with.

### Strickland & IAC
* Even if representation isn't constitutionally inadequate (IAC), defense lawyer might still be subject to discipline

### Diligence
* Fiduciary held to a higher std of care
    * Ls are held to the highest SoC--even among fiduciaries
* Reasonably consult w/ C about means used to achieve C's goals

## September 17, 2013
* Waterboarding hypo: 1.1, 1.4 (communicate w/ client), 2.1 (duty to advise C even if C doesn't want to hear)
* 5.2: A subordinate L is still bound by the rules, but there's some latitude if the sr. L's position is defensible.
* [[ WE spent a lot of time on the waterboarding hypo ]]
* Limiting services under 1.2(c)
    * You may, but it has to be reasonable, and C has to give informed consent
    * Good to get this in writing since it's a frequent source of misunderstanding

### Who calls the shots
* 1.2: L has to abide by C's decision re: objectives.
    * Not a clear demarcation b/w means & ends
    * L shall abide by C's decision to settle or plead out
* 1.14: If C has diminished capacity, try to have as normal a relationship as possible
    * Unless C is going to endanger herself bodily or financially or otherwise

#### Unabomber Case
* Opt 1: 2.1, 1.1, 1.2(a)
* Opt 3: 1.4 (lying to C goes against getting informed consent), 1.2(d) (engaging in misrepresentation)
