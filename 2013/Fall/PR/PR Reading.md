## Chapter 3: the Duty to Protect Client Confidences

### The Basic Principle of Confidentiality

* **Rule 1.6(a)** Confidentiality of Information
	* Lawyer can't reveal client info unless: 
		* client gives informed consent **OR**
		* the client implicitly authorizes the disclosure **OR**
		* an exception from 1.6(b) applies
	* *Comment 4:*
		* This includes any disclosure that might help a 3rd party identify C
		* Hypos are okay as long as they don't lead back to C
* 1.6 covers everything the lawyer learns relating to representing the client whether it's from the client or another source.
* Confidential info includes:
	* Anything related to the matter L represents C regarding (unless it's "generally known")
		* Regardless of whether L learned it before or after representation.
	* Any personal info
	* L's notes

* **Policy:** Confidentiality encourages disclosure that facilitates L's representation of C's interests.

### Protecting Info When There Is a Reasonable Prospect of Harm to C's Interest

* 3rd Rest: Confidential info regarding L's representation of C, unless info is generally known.
	* But revealing confidential info is okay with consent or if there isn't a reasonable prospect that doing so would harm C's interests
	* "reasonable prospect" means that a reasonable L would think there was an unreasonable risk of harm to C's objectives or interests. 
* Rest. may be closer to the actual prof'l std.
* ABA sez: don't use C's work email for discussing representation, since their work may be reading.

### Exceptions
* Permissive:
	* If the client gives informed consent
	* The disclosure is impliedly authorized
	* If a disclosure is against C's interest, L shd try to convince C to obviate the need for L to disclose, and L shd make the disclosure as narrow as possible
	* To prevent death or SBH
	* To prevent C from commiting a crime or fraud that will injure someone else's finances or property
	* To get legal advice about complying with the rules
	* To comply with the law or a ct order
* Compulsory:

#### Risk of Death or SBH
* Value of life & bodily integrity > value of confidentiality
* Some states allow L to disclose C's intent to commit *any* crime
