## Chapter 3: the Duty to Protect Client Confidences

### The Basic Principle of Confidentiality

* **Rule 1.6(a)** Confidentiality of Information
	* Lawyer can't reveal client info unless: 
		* client gives informed consent **OR**
		* the client implicitly authorizes the disclosure **OR**
		* an exception from 1.6(b) applies
	* *Comment 4:*
		* This includes any disclosure that might help a 3rd party identify C
		* Hypos are okay as long as they don't lead back to C
* 1.6 covers everything the lawyer learns relating to representing the client whether it's from the client or another source.
* Confidential info includes:
	* Anything related to the matter L represents C regarding (unless it's "generally known")
		* Regardless of whether L learned it before or after representation.
	* Any personal info
	* L's notes

* **Policy:** Confidentiality encourages disclosure that facilitates L's representation of C's interests.

### Protecting Info When There Is a Reasonable Prospect of Harm to C's Interest

* 3rd Rest: Confidential info regarding L's representation of C, unless info is generally known.
	* But revealing confidential info is okay with consent or if there isn't a reasonable prospect that doing so would harm C's interests
	* "reasonable prospect" means that a reasonable L would think there was an unreasonable risk of harm to C's objectives or interests. 
* Rest. may be closer to the actual prof'l std.
* ABA sez: don't use C's work email for discussing representation, since their work may be reading.

### Exceptions
* Permissive:
	* If the client gives informed consent
	* The disclosure is impliedly authorized
	* If a disclosure is against C's interest, L shd try to convince C to obviate the need for L to disclose, and L shd make the disclosure as narrow as possible
	* To prevent death or SBH
	* To prevent C from commiting a crime or fraud that will injure someone else's finances or property
	* To get legal advice about complying with the rules
	* To comply with the law or a ct order
* Compulsory:

#### Risk of Death or SBH
* Value of life & bodily integrity > value of confidentiality
* Some states allow L to disclose C's intent to commit *any* crime

#### Client fraud & financial harm
* **Rule 1.2(d)** L can't assist C in crime or fraud
	* Incl: delivering or affirming fraudulent docs or advising in the commission of crime
* **Rule 1.0(d) DEF Fraud:** whatever legally constitutes fraud in the jxn undertaken with the purpose to deceive
* Tortious fraud: 
	1. ∆ intentionally
	2. Misrepresented a fact, intention or law
	3. Intending to induce reliance on that misrepresentation
	4. and the client suffered financial loss
	5. as a result of that reliance
* Criminal fraud: statutes make some kinds of fraud criminal, depending on the jxn.
* Contract fraud: Misrepresentation needn't be intentional for a K to be voidable as long as it was *material*
* L might be found to aid C's fraud if he doesn't exercise the prevailing std of care.
* L shd be extra careful if C has a history of misrepresentation.
* **Rule 4.1(b)** L's must disclose nonconfidential info in order to prevent assisting C's fraud
	* Comment 1: omissions or partially true (but misleading) statements can be misrepresentation

#### Mitigating
* **Rule 1.6(b)(2)**: L can disclose when he learns C plans to commit fraud using documents L helped create in working for C when that fraud will cause substantial financial harm (C's future fraud)
* **Rule 1.6(b)(3)**: Or to prevent, mitigate or rectify that harm. (C's past fraud)
* But if C didn't use L's help to commit the fraud, and C hired L for representation relating to the fraud, these exceptions don't apply.
* **Rule 4.1** If the only way to prevent the fraud is for L to disclose, then L *must* do so (unless prevented by 1.6)

#### Using C's info to protect L's interest (self-defense exception)
* If L has to disclose in order to protect his own interests (per 1.6(b)(5)) the disclosure has to be as narrow as possible
* L can disclose preemptively. No need to wait for an action to commence
* But L has to tell C before disclosing & try to work out another solution

#### Complying with the law/court order
* **1.6(b)(6)** law/ct order trumps confidentiality
* Summary on p. 224.

### Conflict of interest
* **1.8(b)** L can't use C's info to C's detriment w/o informed consent.

## Chapter 5: Relationship between L&C
* [**Rule 1.1**](http://www.law.cornell.edu/ethics/aba/current/ABA_CODE.HTM#Rule_1.1 "Model Rules of Professional Conduct (2004)"): L must provide competent representation
	* Comment 2: L doesn't have to know anything about the area of the law where C needs help as long as L has time to learn about it.
* L can bill for time it takes to "get up to speed" on law or other subj. matter, but not too much, and should communicate that ahead of time
* L generally has discretion in which clients to take and what work he'll do for those clients, but [**6.1**](http://www.law.cornell.edu/ethics/aba/current/ABA_CODE.HTM#Rule_6.1 "Model Rules of Professional Conduct (2004)") says Ls should try to do 50 hrs/yr of pro bono work, and preferably for unpopular ppl (c1)
* [**6.2**](http://www.law.cornell.edu/ethics/aba/current/ABA_CODE.HTM#Rule_6.2 "Model Rules of Professional Conduct (2004)") L can't turn down an appointment to defend an indigent client, unless it would: (a) violate a rule; (b) cause under financial burden; or (c) C's crime was so repugnant to L that L's representation would suffer.
* **Legal malpractice std**:
	1. L&C had an atty-client relationship
	2. L acted negligently or in breach of K
	3. L's act was a proximate cause of harm to C
	4. L's act was an actual (but for) cause of harm to C

### Strickland & IAC:
* On appeal, ∆ has to show orig. L was egregiously bad (L didn't meet 6A requirement for counsel) **AND** that a better lawyer would've affected the outcome below (L's deficiency was prejudicial)
* KY v Padilla: IAC to fail to disclose immigration consequences.

### Diligence
* [**Rule 1.3**](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_3_diligence.html "Rule 1.3: Diligence | The Center for Professional Responsibility"): L shall represent C w/ reasonable *diligence* & *promptness*
* C3: Zealous advocacy
* 1.2(c) L can limit the scope of his representation if C gives incformed consent
	* L can help with part of a case or at one stage of litigation: "unbundled services"

### Truthfulness
* 3.3(a) & 4.1 say L can't lie to tribunals or non-clients, but nothing explicitly says L can't lie to clients.
* 8.4(c) says L can't commit fraud or misrepresentation
* 1.4 imposes a duty to keep client informed in matters involving: informed consent; a decision by C; re: status; and about things C asked about

### Candor
* 2.1: L should give candid advice based not just on the law but moral, social, economic & political factors

### Who calls the shots?
* [**Rule 1.2**](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_2_scope_of_representation_allocation_of_authority_between_client_lawyer.html "Rule 1.2: Scope of Representation & Allocation of Authority Between Client & Lawyer | The Center for Professional Responsibility")
* 1.2 & 1.4 work together to make L keep C informed and let C make informed decisions
* Technical legal matters are up to the lawyer

#### Jones v. Barnes
* L does not have to raise every issue C wants to raise

#### Cs w/ diminished capacity
* [**Rule 1.14**](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_14_client_with_diminished_capacity.html "Rule 1.14: Client with Diminished Capacity | The Center for Professional Responsibility")
	* L has to try to have as normal a L-C relationship as possible
	* If L thinks C is at risk of substantial harm (of any kind) she can consult w/ others to protect C or possibly even seek to appoint a guardian
		* L is impliedly auth'd to disclose info for this purpose
* Comment 6 instructs Ls how to assess capacity

#### Juveniles
* Kids may have opinions that need to be respected
* Kids have the same legal autonomy as adults in criminal and delinquency proceedings
* If L is appointed as a guardian ad litem, L doesn't have to respect C's preferences

### Terminating the relationship
* L has to show C a copy of any docs related to the representation
* L has to deliver docs promptly after representation ends
* L can refuse if she hasn't been paid unless the refusal would unreasonably harm C
* [**Rule 1.16**](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_16_declining_or_terminating_representation.html "Rule 1.16: Declining or Terminating Representation | The Center for Professional Responsibility") covers termination of L-C relationship before the work is done
* L can fire C if continued representation would constitute a crime
* L can withdraw if it wouldn't materially adversely affect C's interests
