## Chapter 3: the Duty to Protect Client Confidences

### The Basic Principle of Confidentiality

* **Rule 1.6(a)** Confidentiality of Information
	* Lawyer can't reveal client info unless: 
		* client gives informed consent **OR**
		* the client implicitly authorizes the disclosure **OR**
		* an exception from 1.6(b) applies
	* *Comment 4:*
		* This includes any disclosure that might help a 3rd party identify C
		* Hypos are okay as long as they don't lead back to C
* 1.6 covers everything the lawyer learns relating to representing the client whether it's from the client or another source.
* Confidential info includes:
	* Anything related to the matter L represents C regarding (unless it's "generally known")
		* Regardless of whether L learned it before or after representation.
	* Any personal info
	* L's notes

* **Policy:** Confidentiality encourages disclosure that facilitates L's representation of C's interests.

### Protecting Info When There Is a Reasonable Prospect of Harm to C's Interest

* 3rd Rest: Confidential info regarding L's representation of C, unless info is generally known.
	* But revealing confidential info is okay with consent or if there isn't a reasonable prospect that doing so would harm C's interests
	* "reasonable prospect" means that a reasonable L would think there was an unreasonable risk of harm to C's objectives or interests. 
* Rest. may be closer to the actual prof'l std.
* ABA sez: don't use C's work email for discussing representation, since their work may be reading.

### Exceptions
* Permissive:
	* If the client gives informed consent
	* The disclosure is impliedly authorized
	* If a disclosure is against C's interest, L shd try to convince C to obviate the need for L to disclose, and L shd make the disclosure as narrow as possible
	* To prevent death or SBH
	* To prevent C from commiting a crime or fraud that will injure someone else's finances or property
	* To get legal advice about complying with the rules
	* To comply with the law or a ct order
* Compulsory:

#### Risk of Death or SBH
* Value of life & bodily integrity > value of confidentiality
* Some states allow L to disclose C's intent to commit *any* crime

#### Client fraud & financial harm
* **Rule 1.2(d)** L can't assist C in crime or fraud
	* Incl: delivering or affirming fraudulent docs or advising in the commission of crime
* **Rule 1.0(d) DEF Fraud:** whatever legally constitutes fraud in the jxn undertaken with the purpose to deceive
* Tortious fraud: 
	1. âˆ† intentionally
	2. Misrepresented a fact, intention or law
	3. Intending to induce reliance on that misrepresentation
	4. and the client suffered financial loss
	5. as a result of that reliance
* Criminal fraud: statutes make some kinds of fraud criminal, depending on the jxn.
* Contract fraud: Misrepresentation needn't be intentional for a K to be voidable as long as it was *material*
* L might be found to aid C's fraud if he doesn't exercise the prevailing std of care.
* L shd be extra careful if C has a history of misrepresentation.
* **Rule 4.1(b)** L's must disclose nonconfidential info in order to prevent assisting C's fraud
	* Comment 1: omissions or partially true (but misleading) statements can be misrepresentation

#### Mitigating
* **Rule 1.6(b)(2)**: L can disclose when he learns C plans to commit fraud using documents L helped create in working for C when that fraud will cause substantial financial harm (C's future fraud)
* **Rule 1.6(b)(3)**: Or to prevent, mitigate or rectify that harm. (C's past fraud)
* But if C didn't use L's help to commit the fraud, and C hired L for representation relating to the fraud, these exceptions don't apply.
* **Rule 4.1** If the only way to prevent the fraud is for L to disclose, then L *must* do so (unless prevented by 1.6)

#### Using C's info to protect L's interest (self-defense exception)
* If L has to disclose in order to protect his own interests (per 1.6(b)(5)) the disclosure has to be as narrow as possible
* L can disclose preemptively. No need to wait for an action to commence
* But L has to tell C before disclosing & try to work out another solution

#### Complying with the law/court order
* **1.6(b)(6)** law/ct order trumps confidentiality
* Summary on p. 224.

### Conflict of interest
* **1.8(b)** L can't use C's info to C's detriment w/o informed consent.
