* The check should be admissible since it makes it more likely Jack intended to arrive at Clear Lake Resort, and his intent to arrive is of consequence to the question of whether he would kill himself en route. The insurance company could argue that he could have changed his mind after writing the check. However, if the only objection is relevancy, then the existence of the check does make it more likely that Jack intended to get to the resort.
* The bank letter should also be introduced as making it more likely (even if it isn't persuasive). âˆ† can argue that Jack could have written the IOU with the intent of killing himself before paying. Does an alternative explanation cancel out the increased probability?

* Admitting to the murder dreams may make Davis's guilt slightly more likely. However, the fact's probative value is very slight, and the jury is likely to overvalue it, so it may be prejudicial. But does that prejudice substantially outweigh the probative value?
* Davis could argue the suicidality was due to his wife's death, and further that, even if the cash and the direction of the car were evidence of flight, that he was fleeing due to fear of wrongful conviction. However, the prosecution could argue that he essentially kidnapped his friend, and that this is evidence that he was prone to illegal behaviors such as murder.
