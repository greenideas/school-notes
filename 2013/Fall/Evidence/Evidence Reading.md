# Evidence
## Chapter 2: Types of Courtroom Evidence

* Evidence is presented to the senses to prove the (non)existence of a fact.

### Types of Evidence

1. **Oral testimony**
	* *Fact Witness* any person who testifies to the facts of the case. Eyewitnesses, people who overheard something, police officer who logged a piece of evidence, etc.
	* *Expert witness* uses specialized knowledge to interpret evidence and/or explain it to the jury. Doesn't need firsthand knowledge.
	* *Character witness* gives info about good or bad character of a party or witness. Doesn't need firsthand knowledge.
2. **Real evidence**: Physical evidence that played a part in the controversy.
	* Must be authenticated
	* Jurors love it.
3. **Documents** 
4. **Demonstrative evidence** didn't play a role in the controversy. PPTs, dummies, a bag of powdered sugar
5. **Stipulation**
6. **Judicial Notice** Judge can declare a fact that is "generally known" or "can be accurately and readily determined"

### Photo & video

Can be demonstrative or real evidence, depending on whether they show the events in controversy or just illustrate something about the dispute (extent of injury, etc.)

### Circumstantial Evidence

* Evidence that requires the jury to infer a connection to a disputed fact.
* At the other end of the spectrum from direct evidence.
* Circumstantial/direct isn't a real legal distinction. Often used rhetorically, though.
* Evidence requiring fewer inferences is more persuasive

## Chapter 3: Four W's of the FRE
### Why follow?
* Levels playing field b/w wealthy/poor litigants
* FRE still gives lots of leeway
* Reasons:
	1. Protect jury from bad/misleading info
	2. Efficiency
	3. Social interests (protected relationships)
	4. Reliability

### Who wrote FRE
* SCOTUS-appointed advisory committee started the process & then congress swooped in & wrote the rules  in 1975
* Ad. comm. restyled the rules in 2011

### Where do rules apply?
* **Rule 101** Rules apply in US courts.
* **Rule 1101(a)** Rules apply in:
	* US dist. cts.
	* US bankruptcy & magistrate judges
	* US cts. of app.
	* Ct. of fed. claims.
	* Guam, VI & N. Mariana Is. dist. cts.
* FRE doesn't apply to SCOTUS
* Cong applied FRE to tax ct.
* States can base their ev. rules on FRE or at least see them as persuasive

### When
* **Rule 1101(b)**
	* Civil cases, incl. bankruptcy, admiralty, and maritime
	* Criminal
	* Contempt proceedings *unless* ct. can act summarily (when judge witnesses contemptuous beh.)
* Rules only apply at trial
* **Rule 1101(c)** Rules on privilege always apply at all stages of a case or proceeding
* **Rule 1101(d)** Exceptions—FRE (except privilege rules) doesn't apply to
	1. Ct's determination of a prelim. question of fact governing admissibility (**104(a)**)
	2. Grand jury proceedings
	3. Misc, such as:
		* Extradition
		* Issuing a warrant
		* Prelim exam in a crim case (is there PC to hold ∆ for trial)
		* Sentencing
		* Probation
		* Bail
* 1101(d)(1): Prelim challenge when a party claims ev. is inadmissible.
* p. 30 flowchart on where/when FRE applies

## Chapter 4: Structure of a Trial
1. Pretrial motions/motions in limine
	* Motion to exclude/introduce evidence
	* Let attys know what evidence will be allowed before trial starts so they can prepare their case
	* Attys can make soph. legal arguments/submit briefs
	* Doesn't happen in front of a jury & so doesn't prejudice the jury.
2. Jury Selection (voir dire)
3. Opening statements.
	* ppl choose sides early on in a trial, before hearing all the facts
	* party w/ burden of proof goes first (prosecutor or π) so they get to establish a framework first
	* May include demonstrative ev.
4. Prosecutor/π case-in-chief
	* All evidence, witnesses, etc. for prosecution.
	* Afterward, ∆ usually moves for JMOL or acquittal
5. ∆'s case-in-chief or case-in-defense
	* ∆ sometimes won't present a case since prosecutor has a high bar & the case might be theirs to lose
6. π's case-in-rebuttal
	* π/pros introduces new ev./witnesses to rebut ∆'s case.
	* Limited to rebutting ∆'s case
7. ∆'s case in rebuttal or case-in-rejoinder
	* Limited to addressing π's rebuttal
8. More rebuttal/rejoinder
	* At judge's discretion
9. Closing Statements
10. Jury instruction
11. Deliberation
	* Jury may get to see some evidence again & get transcripts of testimony
12. Verdict

## Chapter 5: Raising & Resolving Evidentiary Objections

### Disputing/Defending Evidence
* **Rule 103(a)** Rulings on evidence. Pty can claim error in a ruling to admit/exclude evidence iff:
	1. The ruling admits evidence and the party
		(A) objects at the time or moves to strike, **AND**
		(B) States a specific ground (unless it's clear from ctx)
* Objections occur before ev. is fully presented. Motions to strike occur after ev. is in the record.
* 7th cir: Objection is timely if it's raised quickly enough for the ct. to correct any error.
* If there are multiple grounds for objection, counsel shd raise them all
* **Rule103(a)(2)**: If the ruling excludes ev., pty claiming error has to inform court of its substance by offerring proof.
* **Rule 103(b)** When a definitive ruling is made, pty doesn't need to renew an objection to preserve it for appeal (i.e. ∆ doesn't have to renew an objection at trial to a ruling made on a motion in limine)
* **Rule 103(d)** Ct has to try to keep jury from hearing inadmissible ev.
* **Rule 105** If ev. is admissible for one purpose or against one party, judge has to restrict its use and instruct the jury accordingly.
	* Lim. instructions may actually make jurors focus *more* on the excluded evidence.

### On Appeal
* **Rule 103(a)** ...Pty can claim error only if the error affects a substantial right.
	* Otherwise it's "harmless error"
* **Rule 103(e)** ct can take notice of plain error affecting a substl right, even if it wasn't properly preserved.  

## Chapter 6: Relevance
* **Rule 402** Relevant evidence is admissible *unless* the const, a statute, FRE, other SCOTUS rules say so. Irrelevant evidence is not admissible.
* **Rule 401** Evidence is relevant if:
	(a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable 
	(b) the fact is of consequence to determining the action
* Low bar
* If a piece of evidence has been barred for being irrelevant to one fact, it may be relevant to another, so may still be introduced
* Ad cmte notes to 401 say that the fact doesn't have to be in controvery to be of consequence, so π can introduce photos of a GSW even if ∆ concedes that was how V died.
* Relevance is scalar, so evidence can be so remotely connected to a controversy as to be irrelevant (ev. of racial bias may not be relevant to age discrim)
	* But psych research shows that ppl with one bias are likely to have others.

### Negative evidence
* Lack of large txns, may be evidence that ∆ isn't a drug dealer & a good lawyer might make the diff. in such a case.

### Hindsight
* In a case of subjective reasonablilty, the actual fact shouldn't be admitted as evidence when it doesn't bear on what the party subjectively knew/believed.

### Opening the Door
* A party can make evidence relevant that wouldn't otherwise be if they raise an issue the other party can introduce the disputed evidence to rebut.

### Case-by-case
* Relevance is usually determined case-by-case. In *Sprint*, SCOTUS essentially ruled out per se restrictions  on categorically irrelevant evidence.

## Chapter 7: Prejudice, Confusion, or Waste of Time
* **Rule 403** Ct *may* exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is *subtantially outweighed* by:
	* *unfair* prejudice
	* confusing the issue or misleading the jury
	* undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence
* **403**: counterweight to 401/402's permissiveness.
* SCOTUS said 403 has to be applied case-by-case
* 403 rulings are rarely rev'd on appeal.
* Because of discretion, 403 claims are an opportunity for advocacy
* "substantially outweighed" == strong presumption of admissibility
* "unfair" prejudice means leading the jury to a conclusion with proof that isn't specific to the controversy *Old Chief v. U.S.*

### In practice
* 5 factors may often apply in 403 decisions:
	1. Extent to which ev will arouse emotion or irrational prejudice in jurors
	2. Extent to which jurors might overvalue evidence (bad forensic evidence?)
	3. Strength of connection b/w evidence & elements of the case.
	4. Is there a less prejudicial/confusing alternative?
	5. Could the prejudice be mitigated after ev is introduced?
* Prejudicial != "harmful to my case"
* Gory photos *may* be okay:
	* Corpse pics showing the position of the body may be used to dispute ∆'s testimony
	* Pics of childrens' bloody handprints from trying to help their dead mom are prejudicial
	* Cts tend to "split the difference" with sets of pics like this.
* Pics of ∆s' luxurious lifestyle might not be prejudicial in an embezzlement trial if they show motive

#### Flight
* Ppl have legit reasons to travel, and juries might overvalue evidence that someone tried to flee a jxn after a crime was committed.
* In US v. Benedetti, the ct excluded evidence of ∆'s flight *until* ∆ brought up the govt's delay in prosecuting (which was due to ∆'s flight). This "opened the door" to testimony re: ∆s flight

#### Stipulations
* Old Chief:
	1. 403 balancing has to happen in light of the full record, including stipulations
	2. Full accounting of a prior conviction has more "descriptive richness" than a stipulation and helps the jury do its job of sitting in moral judgment
	3. **But** in the specific case of a felon-in-possession statute where any prior felony conviction will do, introducing the record describing the prior conviction may be prejudicial
* Old Chief has largely been a windfall for prosecutors who get to use its language to show the value of introducing priors.
	* But it's a small victory for ∆s in the narrow circumstances of felon-in-possession violations.

#### Undue Delay
* Judge didn't let Scooter Libby spam the jury with tons of docs about terrorist groups they'd never heard of since it would be time-consuming and confusing

#### Bench trials
* The prejudicial part of 403 doesn't come up when a judge is the fact-finder (since a judge won't say (s)he can't fairly decide a case in light of the proffer)
	* But litigants still invoke 403 to argue ev will delay or is unduly cumulative


## Chapter 8 — Fitting the Rules Together
* 401 is a net with a very wide mesh. It's at the mouth of the river and lets a ton of fish through
* 403 is at the end of the river, has a slightly tighter mesh than 401/402, and is the judge's last opporunity to keep the fish away from the jury (ocean?)

## Chapter 9 - Subsequent Remedial Mesaures
* 407-411 all exclude different types of evidence but have two kinds of goals in common:
	1. *Promoting socially valuable activity* (plea bargaining or buying insurance) by protecting ppl who do them from having certiain evidence used against them
	2. *Preventing unfair prejudice* that would result from the kinds of evidence covered. Juries would likely overweight these kinds of ev.
* Require L to state the purpose of introing the evidence since it might be excluded for one purpose but admitted for another
* **Rule 407 - Subsequent Remedial Measures** π can't introduce evidence that ∆ took subsequent measures that would have made an injury less likely to occur as evidence of:
	* Negligence
	* Culpable conduct
	* Defective product design or mfg
	* Need for warning/instruction
* **But** those measure can be introduced for:
	* impeachment 
	* or if disputed (to show ownership or control, or feasability of the remedial measures)

### In the courtroom
* **"Measure?"**: Overt act, pulling product from market, policy change
* **"Subsequent?:"** Only covers acts taken after the injury. Measures taken after the sale of a product but before π's injury dont count.
	* Fixing problems before they hurt someone (thus avoiding litigation altogether) is enough of an incentive
* **Nonparties**: even though 407 doesn't distinguish b/w measures taken by (non)parties, cts usually only exclude evidence of measures by parties b/c that's who the incentive policy applies to.

### Ownership & control
* If π claims not to control the cause of the accident, but then takes remedial steps, ∆ can introduce evidence of the measures to show π has control. (opening the door)

### Feasibility
* Same as ownership. π can't claim remedial measures weren't feasible but then go and do them.
* But what's feasible may change, so this can be litigated.
* Also, like O&C has to be disputed by ∆ before π can introduce.

### Impeachment
* Interpreted narrowly to keep the exception from swallowing the rule
* Needs to be a close fit between the testimony to be impeached and the measures taken
	* Witness makes specific statement that conflicts w/ measures taken
	* Witness makes absolute statement (the product was perfectly safe)
	* The witness was personally involved with the measure
* ∆ should avoid calling witnesses that were involved in the measures.
	* Or keep witnesses from making absolute statements (the original design was the best and safest)

### Rules 105 & 403
* 105 (lim. instr.) & 403 (unfair prejudice) compliment 407.
* If ev is allowed for showing O&C or feasibility, π can request a lim. instr. to keep it from being considered as showing liability.
* If π thinks lim. instr. won't be sufficient, he can argue the ev would be prejudicial under 403.

## Chapter 10: Settlements and Offers to compromise
* Settling is efficient, so we don't want to create incentives against it.
* Also super prejudicial.
* **Rule 408(a)** Below are not admissible *by any party*
	* (1) Giving, offering, or promising (or accepting any of same) value as a compromise
	* (2) Conduct or statement during negotiation of the compromise except in a criminal case or when the claim is by a public office exercising its regulatory, investigative or enforcement authority
* **408(a)** Not admissible to (dis)prove an amount of a disputed claim or to impeach a prior inconsistent statement
* 408 only applies when the dispute has matured into a "claim"
* Exclusion is limited to those purposes mentioned
* **408(b)** Exceptions: This evidence can be admitted to:
	* Prove a witness's bias or prejudice
	* negate a contention of undue delay
	* prove effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution
* Civil settlements may be introduced as evidence in *some* criminal trials but only when the civil proceeding involved a public office acting in an investigative, regulatory, or enforcement powers.
* Flow chart on pg. 115.

### In the courtroom
* Is there a claim? Yes, when a party hires an atty and threatens to sue.
* Have there been compromise negotiations? Unilateral approach of one party != negotiation
* Showing intent to continue talking can be evidence of continuing negotiation
* Settlements with 3rd parties are excluded, too
* Settlements can be used to show bias. If a witness got a lot of money by settling with a party, she might be biased towards that party
	* Impeachments for bias != impeachments for inconsistency. Only the former are admissible.
* 408 doesn't cover plea bargaining.

## Chapter 11: Medical Expenses
* **Rule 409** Paying, or offering or promising to pay medical expenses (or similar) is not admissible for the purpose of showing liability.
* **409** doesn't require a dispute in order to bar introduction (contrast **408**).
* Doesn't exclude anything said along with the payment (or offer, etc.
* "medical expenses" includes things like PT, and maybe therapy, but not any economic or property damage

## Chapter 12: Criminal Plea Bargaining
* Gov't has an interest in promoting plea bargains, but judicial system has inteterest in protecting ∆s from prosecutorial overreach
* **Rule 410**
	* **Prohibited uses**: In a civil or criminal case, the following isn't admissible against ∆ who participated in plea negotiations or entered the plea
		* (i.e. ∆ can still introduce anything from the process against others)
	* **Excluded evidence:**
		* A guilty plea subsequently withdrawn
		* Nolo contendre plea (even if entered)
		* A statement made during either of the above pleas (either in or out of court)
		* A statement made during plea *discussions with an attorney* if those discussions didn't result in an entered & finalized plea
	* **Exceptions:** Statements made during negotiations for a nolo plea or a guilty plea that is not entered or is subsequently withdrawn may be admitted if:
		* another statement from the same plea/discussion have been admitted, and the statements should be considered together out of fairness
			* (i.e. if ∆ introduces something from those talks, might be able to as well, per the judge's discretion)
		* **OR** in a criminal trial for perjury or false statement, and ∆ made the statement: under oath, on the record, **AND** with counsel present
			* (limited exception, since this isn't ususally how plea negotiations happen)
			* Might apply if ∆ is responding in court to questions from the judge after entering the plea
* 410 **does not** exclude final guilty pleas. Pleas entered have the same status as criminal convictions.
* Neither does it exclude discussions/statements during the bargaining for a guilty plea that is subsequently entered
* Talks with prosecutors might be "plea discussions;" statements to police with no prosecutor present usually aren't
* Statements may be considered part of a "plea discussion" if:
	* ∆ *manifested* a subjective belief that he was negotiating a plea **AND**
	* That understanding was reasonable
* ∆ **may** waive his rights under 410, and a prosecutor can ask him to do so as a condition for negotiations

#### 403
* Statements from negotiations can be excluded from use against the prosecution under 403 (e.g. if ∆ tries to intro π's willingness to negotiate as showing weakness of π's case)

## Chapter 13: Liability Insurance
* We want people to have insurance so they can compensate people they harm
* And insurance is an efficient way to spread cost & pool risk
* **Rule 411** Ev that ∆ was(n't) insured against liability **is not** admissible to prove that ∆ acted wrongly but **is** admissible to prove:
	* Witness bias/prejudice
	* Agency, ownership, control
* Health ins. isn't liability ins (or life or disability)
* Whether indemnity agreements count depends on the judge	

## Chapter 14: Putting a Witness on the Stand
* Art VI of the Rules deals with who can testify at trial.

### 601
* **Rule 601** Everyone is competent to be a witness *unless* a specific rule prohibits them.
	* State law re: competency applies in a civil case where state law supplies the elements of the claim or defense

### 605 Judges' competence
* **Rule 605** A presiding judge can't testify as a witness. Parties don't have to object to preserve this issue.
	* This includes commentary from the bench that amounts to testimony

### 606 Jurors' competence
* **Rule 606** (a) A juror can't testify as a witness at trial
	* (b) if a juror is called, opposing counsel has to have an opportunity to object w/o the jury present

### 602 Personal knowledge
* **Rule 602** Witness has to have personal knowdlege of the matter about which they're testifying (witness can show personal knowledge through her own testimony)
	* This doesn't apply to expert testimony
* May sometime be used to rein in 601's broadness.

### 603 Oath requirement
* **Rule 603** Witnesses have to make some kind of statement or affirmation that they intend to give accurate testimony

### 604 Interpreters
* **Rule 604** An interpreter has to be qualified and affirm that she intends to translate faithfully
