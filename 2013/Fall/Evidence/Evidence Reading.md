# Evidence
## Chapter 2: Types of Courtroom Evidence

* Evidence is presented to the senses to prove the (non)existence of a fact.

### Types of Evidence

1. **Oral testimony**
	* *Fact Witness* any person who testifies to the facts of the case. Eyewitnesses, people who overheard something, police officer who logged a piece of evidence, etc.
	* *Expert witness* uses specialized knowledge to interpret evidence and/or explain it to the jury. Doesn't need firsthand knowledge.
	* *Character witness* gives info about good or bad character of a party or witness. Doesn't need firsthand knowledge.
2. **Real evidence**: Physical evidence that played a part in the controversy.
	* Must be authenticated
	* Jurors love it.
3. **Documents** 
4. **Demonstrative evidence** didn't play a role in the controversy. PPTs, dummies, a bag of powdered sugar
5. **Stipulation**
6. **Judicial Notice** Judge can declare a fact that is "generally known" or "can be accurately and readily determined"

### Photo & video

Can be demonstrative or real evidence, depending on whether they show the events in controversy or just illustrate something about the dispute (extent of injury, etc.)

### Circumstantial Evidence

* Evidence that requires the jury to infer a connection to a disputed fact.
* At the other end of the spectrum from direct evidence.
* Circumstantial/direct isn't a real legal distinction. Often used rhetorically, though.
* Evidence requiring fewer inferences is more persuasive

## Chapter 3: Four W's of the FRE
### Why follow?
* Levels playing field b/w wealthy/poor litigants
* FRE still gives lots of leeway
* Reasons:
	1. Protect jury from bad/misleading info
	2. Efficiency
	3. Social interests (protected relationships)
	4. Reliability

### Who wrote FRE
* SCOTUS-appointed advisory committee started the process & then congress swooped in & wrote the rules  in 1975
* Ad. comm. restyled the rules in 2011

### Where do rules apply?
* **Rule 101** Rules apply in US courts.
* **Rule 1101(a)** Rules apply in:
	* US dist. cts.
	* US bankruptcy & magistrate judges
	* US cts. of app.
	* Ct. of fed. claims.
	* Guam, VI & N. Mariana Is. dist. cts.
* FRE doesn't apply to SCOTUS
* Cong applied FRE to tax ct.
* States can base their ev. rules on FRE or at least see them as persuasive

### When
* **Rule 1101(b)**
	* Civil cases, incl. bankruptcy, admiralty, and maritime
	* Criminal
	* Contempt proceedings *unless* ct. can act summarily (when judge witnesses contemptuous beh.)
* Rules only apply at trial
* **Rule 1101(c)** Rules on privilege always apply at all stages of a case or proceeding
* **Rule 1101(d)** Exceptions—FRE (except privilege rules) doesn't apply to
	1. Ct's determination of a prelim. question of fact governing admissibility (**104(a)**)
	2. Grand jury proceedings
	3. Misc, such as:
		* Extradition
		* Issuing a warrant
		* Prelim exam in a crim case (is there PC to hold ∆ for trial)
		* Sentencing
		* Probation
		* Bail
* 1101(d)(1): Prelim challenge when a party claims ev. is inadmissible.
* p. 30 flowchart on where/when FRE applies

## Chapter 4: Structure of a Trial
1. Pretrial motions/motions in limine
	* Motion to exclude/introduce evidence
	* Let attys know what evidence will be allowed before trial starts so they can prepare their case
	* Attys can make soph. legal arguments/submit briefs
	* Doesn't happen in front of a jury & so doesn't prejudice the jury.
2. Jury Selection (voir dire)
3. Opening statements.
	* ppl choose sides early on in a trial, before hearing all the facts
	* party w/ burden of proof goes first (prosecutor or π) so they get to establish a framework first
	* May include demonstrative ev.
4. Prosecutor/π case-in-chief
	* All evidence, witnesses, etc. for prosecution.
	* Afterward, ∆ usually moves for JMOL or acquittal
5. ∆'s case-in-chief or case-in-defense
	* ∆ sometimes won't present a case since prosecutor has a high bar & the case might be theirs to lose
6. π's case-in-rebuttal
	* π/pros introduces new ev./witnesses to rebut ∆'s case.
	* Limited to rebutting ∆'s case
7. ∆'s case in rebuttal or case-in-rejoinder
	* Limited to addressing π's rebuttal
8. More rebuttal/rejoinder
	* At judge's discretion
9. Closing Statements
10. Jury instruction
11. Deliberation
	* Jury may get to see some evidence again & get transcripts of testimony
12. Verdict

## Chapter 5: Raising & Resolving Evidentiary Objections

### Disputing/Defending Evidence
* **Rule 103(a)** Rulings on evidence. Pty can claim error in a ruling to admit/exclude evidence iff:
	1. The ruling admits evidence and the party
		(A) objects at the time or moves to strike, **AND**
		(B) States a specific ground (unless it's clear from ctx)
* Objections occur before ev. is fully presented. Motions to strike occur after ev. is in the record.
* 7th cir: Objection is timely if it's raised quickly enough for the ct. to correct any error.
* If there are multiple grounds for objection, counsel shd raise them all
* **Rule103(a)(2)**: If the ruling excludes ev., pty claiming error has to inform court of its substance by offerring proof.
* **Rule 103(b)** When a definitive ruling is made, pty doesn't need to renew an objection to preserve it for appeal (i.e. ∆ doesn't have to renew an objection at trial to a ruling made on a motion in limine)
* **Rule 103(d)** Ct has to try to keep jury from hearing inadmissible ev.
* **Rule 105** If ev. is admissible for one purpose or against one party, judge has to restrict its use and instruct the jury accordingly.
	* Lim. instructions may actually make jurors focus *more* on the excluded evidence.

### On Appeal
* **Rule 103(a)** ...Pty can claim error only if the error affects a substantial right.
	* Otherwise it's "harmless error"
* **Rule 103(e)** ct can take notice of plain error affecting a substl right, even if it wasn't properly preserved.  

## Chapter 6: Relevance
* **Rule 402** Relevant evidence is admissible *unless* the const, a statute, FRE, other SCOTUS rules say so. Irrelevant evidence is not admissible.
* **Rule 401** Evidence is relevant if:
	(a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable 
	(b) the fact is of consequence to determining the action
* Low bar
* If a piece of evidence has been barred for being irrelevant to one fact, it may be relevant to another, so may still be introduced
* Ad cmte notes to 401 say that the fact doesn't have to be in controvery to be of consequence, so π can introduce photos of a GSW even if ∆ concedes that was how V died.
* Relevance is scalar, so evidence can be so remotely connected to a controversy as to be irrelevant (ev. of racial bias may not be relevant to age discrim)
	* But psych research shows that ppl with one bias are likely to have others.

### Negative evidence
* Lack of large txns, may be evidence that ∆ isn't a drug dealer & a good lawyer might make the diff. in such a case.

### Hindsight
* In a case of subjective reasonablilty, the actual fact shouldn't be admitted as evidence when it doesn't bear on what the party subjectively knew/believed.

### Opening the Door
* A party can make evidence relevant that wouldn't otherwise be if they raise an issue the other party can introduce the disputed evidence to rebut.

### Case-by-case
* Relevance is usually determined case-by-case. In *Sprint*, SCOTUS essentially ruled out per se restrictions  on categorically irrelevant evidence.
