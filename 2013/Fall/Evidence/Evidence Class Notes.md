# Evidence Class Notes

## August 26, 2013
### Types of Evidence
#### Oral Testimony
* **Fact witnesses**: Firsthand knowledge
* Can be direct (perceived) or indirect
	* Direct: eyewitness
	* Indirect: lab tech, third party heard a confession
* **Expert witnesses**: Don't need firsthand knowledge
	* ME testifies to the contents of a report even if she didn't do the autopsy
	* Specialized knowledge (not nec. formal training)
* **Character witnesses**: Don't need firsthand knowledge
	* Lim. use
	* Testify to the good/bad character of the ∆ or another witness.
	* Establish or impugn credibility

#### Real Evidence
* Phys. evidence that's part of the controversy
* Has to be authenticated

#### Demonstrative Evidence
* No role in actual events
* Explains or illustrates concepts or facts. Can represent actual evidence.
* **Rights determining** (lease/contracts/wills)
* **Suggestive** (recordings/emails/letters)

#### Stipulations
* Both parties agree to a fact

#### Judicial Notice
* Indisputably true fact
* Has to be "generally known" or from and unimpeachable source

#### Circumstantial evidence
* Direct ev. directly establishes fact; no inference required
* Cicumstantial ev. needs an inference to connect it to the controversy

* Goals: relevance, accuracy, reliability, efficiency

### EyeID
* If you suggest that something happened, people will fill in details about it.
	* The guy didn't point at anything, but I thought he pointed at the clock.
* FRE is based on incorrect assumptions about human behavior

### FRE
* Pre-FRE: Common law
* FRE
	* Advisory cmte (judges, lawyers, profs) ->
	* SCOTUS ->
	* Congress
* Future modifications:
	* Congress
	* Ad cmte -> SCOTUS -> Congress
* Melendez-Diaz: Which lab personnel can come testify at trial?
	* If ∆ has advance notice that person preparing certificate will testify and doesn't object, then no conf. cl. violation.
* 2011 restyling doesn't make a substantive difference in outcome

#### Interpreting FRE
* Plain meaning
* Ad. cmte notes (& congressional record)
* Policy "what's good for America?" arguments.

#### Where do they apply?
* All fed cts, incl bankruptcy & magistrate judges
* Civil & criminal cases
* Not state cts, but many are similar
* Grandma with TBI robs a bank but is NGRI. When she's treated & maybe ready to get out, do FRE apply at her hearing?
	* Maybe? It's not on the § 1101 list.

### Trial Structure
#### Motions in limine (pretrial)
* File motion in limine requesting that opposing counsel respond on point and in writing to every motion, then spam the hell out of them with motions. Good way to get LWOP in a capital case.
* Filing motions in limine helps you see what the judge is going to let in or bar, and then you know what the trial is going to look like (or whether you should go to trial at all).
* Judges can be making things up as they go along, so motions may help them figure out how to proceed.
* Judges look to the facts of the case in deciding how to rule on motions rather than consulting precedent.

#### π case-in-chief 
* Direct exam is very open-ended: "tell me how x works"
* Cross undermines testimony from direct

#### ∆ case-in-chief
* same as π's case-in-chief but in reverse

### Objections
* Error has to be preserved with a timely objection **AND** affect a substantial right to raise it on appeal
* If judge makes a definitive ruling on a motion, you don't *have* to object (FRE 103(b)) in order to preserve it for appeal, but you should
	* But if the ruling isn't definitive you do have to renew your objection
* If something comes out that shouldn't, then you move to strike
	* And get a curative (limiting) instruction
* To object, you have to state a specific ground, and even if you think the judge will know what the ground is, you should say it anyway
	* If you say the number if the rule, it can keep the jury from knowing why you're objecting
	* But if you want to know the jury to hear, you can articulate.
* Proffer: this is the evidence I want to come in
	* You should state why the ev. is important (offer of proof) so the record reflects it for appeal.
	* If there's an objection, ask to approach the bench and proffer there (so the jury doesn't hear)
* **103(c)**: The court can direct an expert to proof relevance through Q&A

#### Key points
* Burden is on pties to make the record
* If you're not sure the ruling is final, make sure, and renew objection regardless
* If there's something that you're going to need on appeal that isn't verbal (sleeping juror, etc.), make sure to state it verbally for the record.
* Make the proffer

#### Judges' options in response to objection
* Overrule & admit evidence
* Sustain & exclude/strike
* Admit w/ limiting instructions
* Admit modified/redacted version
* Admit for limited purpose or limited parties.

#### Limiting instructions
* **Rule 105** If scope of evidence is restricted, the court **must** restrict & give limiting instruction

### Relevance
* Low bar
* 401: If ev has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable, it's relevant
	* As long as the fact is of consequence 
* depends on substantive loaw & each party's theory of the case
* Relavance changes as facts and arguments change
* Tightly linked to culture
* 402: Exclude ev if any of the following say so:  const, fed law, other FRE, other SCOTUS
* "any tendency" + "more or less probable" == very low bar
* Relevance is the first net ev has to pass through, and it has huge holes
* Not inherent to a piece of evidence
	* The substantive law matters.
* "of consequence"
	* Ultimate proposition (is ∆ the guy who killed V)
	* Link in the chain (∆ was in the location where V was killed)
* New facts coming in can make ev relevance that wasn't before & vice versa
* Culture matters: in WA, where recreational marijuana use is legal, it isn't relevant to ∆ selling cocaine.
	* 20 years ago, maybe it would be more likely to be relevant

#### Irrelevant
* Ev that doesn't tend to prove assertion
* Ev does tend to prove proposition, but the the proposition isn't of consequence

#### Main questions
* Theory of the case
	* π
	* ∆
* Fit b/w evidence and theory
	* Fit w/ moving party
	* Damage to party trying to exclude it
* Admissibility/Exclusion

		* Admit?
