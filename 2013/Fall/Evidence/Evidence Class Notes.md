# Evidence Class Notes

## August 26, 2013
### Types of Evidence
#### Oral Testimony
* **Fact witnesses**: Firsthand knowledge
* Can be direct (perceived) or indirect
	* Direct: eyewitness
	* Indirect: lab tech, third party heard a confession
* **Expert witnesses**: Don't need firsthand knowledge
	* ME testifies to the contents of a report even if she didn't do the autopsy
	* Specialized knowledge (not nec. formal training)
* **Character witnesses**: Don't need firsthand knowledge
	* Lim. use
	* Testify to the good/bad character of the ∆ or another witness.
	* Establish or impugn credibility

#### Real Evidence
* Phys. evidence that's part of the controversy
* Has to be authenticated

#### Demonstrative Evidence
* No role in actual events
* Explains or illustrates concepts or facts. Can represent actual evidence.
* **Rights determining** (lease/contracts/wills)
* **Suggestive** (recordings/emails/letters)

#### Stipulations
* Both parties agree to a fact

#### Judicial Notice
* Indisputably true fact
* Has to be "generally known" or from and unimpeachable source

#### Circumstantial evidence
* Direct ev. directly establishes fact; no inference required
* Cicumstantial ev. needs an inference to connect it to the controversy

## August 27, 2013
* Goals: relevance, accuracy, reliability, efficiency

### EyeID
* If you suggest that something happened, people will fill in details about it.
	* The guy didn't point at anything, but I thought he pointed at the clock.
* FRE is based on incorrect assumptions about human behavior

### FRE
* Pre-FRE: Common law
* FRE
	* Advisory cmte (judges, lawyers, profs) ->
	* SCOTUS ->
	* Congress
* Future modifications:
	* Congress
	* Ad cmte -> SCOTUS -> Congress
* Melendez-Diaz: Which lab personnel can come testify at trial?
	* If ∆ has advance notice that person preparing certificate will testify and doesn't object, then no conf. cl. violation.
* 2011 restyling doesn't make a substantive difference in outcome

#### Interpreting FRE
* Plain meaning
* Ad. cmte notes (& congressional record)
* Policy "what's good for America?" arguments.

#### Where do they apply?
* All fed cts, incl bankruptcy & magistrate judges
* Civil & criminal cases
* Not state cts, but many are similar
* Grandma with TBI robs a bank but is NGRI. When she's treated & maybe ready to get out, do FRE apply at her hearing?
	* Maybe? It's not on the § 1101 list.

### Trial Structure
#### Motions in limine (pretrial)
* File motion in limine requesting that opposing counsel respond on point and in writing to every motion, then spam the hell out of them with motions. Good way to get LWOP in a capital case.
* Filing motions in limine helps you see what the judge is going to let in or bar, and then you know what the trial is going to look like (or whether you should go to trial at all).
* Judges can be making things up as they go along, so motions may help them figure out how to proceed.
* Judges look to the facts of the case in deciding how to rule on motions rather than consulting precedent.

#### π case-in-chief 
* Direct exam is very open-ended: "tell me how x works"
* Cross undermines testimony from direct

#### ∆ case-in-chief
* same as π's case-in-chief but in reverse

## August 28, 2013
### Objections
* Error has to be preserved with a timely objection **AND** affect a substantial right to raise it on appeal
* If judge makes a definitive ruling on a motion, you don't *have* to object (FRE 103(b)) in order to preserve it for appeal, but you should
	* But if the ruling isn't definitive you do have to renew your objection
* If something comes out that shouldn't, then you move to strike
	* And get a curative (limiting) instruction
* To object, you have to state a specific ground, and even if you think the judge will know what the ground is, you should say it anyway
	* If you say the number if the rule, it can keep the jury from knowing why you're objecting
	* But if you want to know the jury to hear, you can articulate.
* Proffer: this is the evidence I want to come in
	* You should state why the ev. is important (offer of proof) so the record reflects it for appeal.
	* If there's an objection, ask to approach the bench and proffer there (so the jury doesn't hear)
* **103(c)**: The court can direct an expert to proof relevance through Q&A

#### Key points
* Burden is on pties to make the record
* If you're not sure the ruling is final, make sure, and renew objection regardless
* If there's something that you're going to need on appeal that isn't verbal (sleeping juror, etc.), make sure to state it verbally for the record.
* Make the proffer

#### Judges' options in response to objection
* Overrule & admit evidence
* Sustain & exclude/strike
* Admit w/ limiting instructions
* Admit modified/redacted version
* Admit for limited purpose or limited parties.

#### Limiting instructions
* **Rule 105** If scope of evidence is restricted, the court **must** restrict & give limiting instruction

### Relevance
* Low bar
* 401: If ev has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable, it's relevant
	* As long as the fact is of consequence 
* depends on substantive loaw & each party's theory of the case
* Relavance changes as facts and arguments change
* Tightly linked to culture
* 402: Exclude ev if any of the following say so: const, fed law, other FRE, other SCOTUS
* "any tendency" + "more or less probable" == very low bar
* Relevance is the first net ev has to pass through, and it has huge holes
* Not inherent to a piece of evidence
	* The substantive law matters.
* "of consequence"
	* Ultimate proposition (is ∆ the guy who killed V)
	* Link in the chain (∆ was in the location where V was killed)
* New facts coming in can make ev relevance that wasn't before & vice versa
* Culture matters: in WA, where recreational marijuana use is legal, it isn't relevant to ∆ selling cocaine.
	* 20 years ago, maybe it would be more likely to be relevant

#### Irrelevant
* Ev that doesn't tend to prove assertion
* Ev does tend to prove proposition, but the the proposition isn't of consequence

#### Main questions
* Theory of the case
	* π
	* ∆
* Fit b/w evidence and theory
	* Fit w/ moving party
	* Damage to party trying to exclude it
* Admissibility/Exclusion
	* Best argument
		* Admit?
			* Opposition
			* Reply
		* Exclude?
			* Opposition
			* Reply
	* Secondary argument
		* Admit?
			* Opposition
			* Reply
		* Exclude?
			* Opposition
			* Reply
* Limiting instruction
	* Limited purpose
	* Limiting instruction
	* Curative

### 403
* Weigh probative value against: unfair prejudice, confusion, undue delay, misleading the jury, waste of time, needless duplication
* Scale is tilted way in favor of probative value
* "substantially outweighs" is essentially a synonym for "improper"
* advocacy can make or break a 403 claim
* Key words: **"may"** (discretion is built in), **substantially outweigh**, **wasting, undue, needlessly**
* ∆ attempts suicide when the bodies are found:
	* 401: Relevant when goes to consciousness of guilt
	* alternatives: might fear dustin, doesn't trust the justice system
	* It's coming in under 401, but the alternatives go into 403 analysis to show prejudice
	* 403:
		* Admit
		* Exclude:
			* Penalty phase: argue that she should get death b/c she doesn't value her own life
* Civil fraud case, π wants to introduce evidence of ∆'s gambling & going to strip clubs.
	* 401: might be excluded by another rule (bad character/propensity)
		* motive: either ∆ is out of money & had to commit fraud to pay gambling debts, or he loves gambling and strippers so much that he will commit fraud to fund his habit
	* 403: worried about bad character value
		* misleads jury
* 403 is bread & butter. You always go to it.
* Murder dream hypo:
	* 401:
		* Admit: almost a confession, consciousness of guilt
		* Exclude: It was a dream. Maybe a joke.	
			* Lie-detectors are so bad that Fed. Cts. accept that ppl don't want to submit to them for fear of false positive.
* Driving past the graveyard w/ 10k headed to Canada.
	* 403:
		* Feeling bad about wife's death. Panic. He started close the border.
		* $10k means different things depending on who's carrying it.
	* Bottom line: admit the ATM slips for the 10k, but not flight or suicidality

## September 4, 2013
### Stipulations
* Extension of 403

#### Old Chief
* ∆ offered to stipulate fact of prior conviction
* Ev of prior conviction was still relevant
* Given the offer to stipulate, ev beyond mere fact of conviction was unfairly prejudicial
* Really bad for ∆s:
	* Even if stipulated, still relevant since π has burden.
	* ? shifts to 403, and it is unfairly prejudicial
* Narrative relevance (storytelling model): "a brick is not a wall, but many bricks build a wall"
	* *How* we tell stories matters
	* Offer to stipulate goes to prejudice
	* ∆'s stipulation 
	* In most cases, offer to stipulate has little effect under 403
* Factors cts consider:
	* Evidence in the context of the record as a whole
	* Is there less unfairly prejudicial ev avail that each purpose
	* [[ check slides ]]
* Diff b/w child porn & felon-in-possession is that in the latter case, cts will actually allow the stipulation. 
* Part of the right to a jury trial is the jury's right to act as the community's moral arbiter, and juries need a story/narrative to make that call

#### Gory pics
* When there's a highly prejudicial photo, the judge might still want to let it in.
* Is there a less inflammatory/prejudicial option? (crime scene photo v. autopsy photo)

### Other accident/lack of accident
* 401/403 balancing
* Other accidents: (ex: lots of accidents at one intersection)
* Modern rule: Proof of other accidents is admissible if it's sufficiently probative of issues in dispute
* Key factors:
	* Degrees of *similarity* (same speeds? same time of day? same tree in the way?)
	* *Remoteness*: how long ago (20 accidents in 1970 and 1 in 2013?)
* Come up in negligence & products liability
* Knowledge/notice (∆ knew or should've known)

* Lack of accidents:
	* Is there any reason we shd think that if there were incidents, π would know about them?
		* Prod. liability: is there a known customer complaint line?
		* Accident: city call center to report accidents?
	* Hard for a jury to weigh lack of accidents

## September 5, 2013
* when 401/403 balancing, ask: Is ev unfairly prej **AND** is there a less prej alternative
* Cts give weight to narrative b/c pros. has such a high burden, so they should have some discrection in how they prove their case
* Always start with the 401 question (is it relevant)
* Establish similarities
* Eliminate possible dissimilarities/rule out other explanations
	* The calculus changes when there are more incidents.
* Changing the theory of the case changes a lot about what might be admissible. 

### Subsequent Remedial Measures
* 407
* 407-411 are clustered around similar policy considerations
	* Often interfere with the goal of accuracy
* Shield ppl who engage in socially valuable acts by prohibiting use of ev of those acts at trial
* Tend to be high on prej (403) & low on probative value (401)
* Admissible for *other* purposes (besides showing liability/fault)(*except* 410)
* Rule 407:
	* Subs. measures aren't admissible to prove:
		* Negligence
		* Culpable conduct
		* Design/mfg defect
		* Need for warning/instruction
	* Above essentially boil down to fault
	* But can be intro'd to 
		* Impeach
		* show ownership/control/feasibility *if disputed*
* Doesn't replace 403

#### What is a measure?
* Putting salt on an icy sidewalk, product recall, putting up a warning, etc.
* Any act making harm less likely to occur
* Limited to measures taken by a party to the suit (not to 3rd parties)

#### Subsequent
* After the injury or harm
* Applies to each ∆ in a multi-∆ suit

#### Policy goals
* promotes beneficial social activity
* Avoid perverse incentives
* Avoids jurors giving too much weight to evidence.

## September 9, 2013
### Settlements
* **408** offers to settle are inadmissible. so are statements made during settlement negotiations.
* Eliminates disincentives to negotiate freely
	* Help come to settlement
* High risk of unfair prejudice:
	* Lots of reasons to settle, but jurors are likely to assume fault

#### When 408 applies 
* "**any** party"
	* Even a party no longer involved in the suit/dispute
* Parties can't introduce: 
	* settlement/statements of other parties
	* their own settlement/statements
	* settlement/statements of 3rd parties
* Not to prove or disprove
* "disputed": 408 doesn't apply when parties agree on liability **and** amount of damages
* "claim":
	* A complaint has been filed
	* A lawyer has been filed **and** threatened to sue
	* Otherwise cts distinguish b/w biz discussions & claims
		* Fed cts lean heavily towards claim. If there's a way to read facts as establishing a claim, it's probably in
* Unlike 407, you **cannot** intro statements to impeach prior inconsistent statement or contradiction 

#### What 408 excludes
* Furnishing, promising or offering
* Accepting, promising to accept, or offering to accept
* As long as there is valuable consideration
	* But there is **always** valuable consideration
* Compromising or attempting to compromise, compromise negotiations	
* One party (unilateral) discussions **don't count**
* Formal phrasing: "w/o prejudice to the claim;" some kind of language showing intent to engange in formal legal discussion
* "conduct" **or** "statement"--basically anything
* Policy:
	* Fed rules want to promote accuracy, and these negotiations do meet that goal, so there has to be a high bar to excluding

#### But not if
* Criminal case, or public office (SEC, IRS, EPA, FDA) acting in its reg, investigative, or enforcement authority (but only if it's the agency that initiated the suit)
	* Criminal case exception doesn't apply when the suit was b/w two private parties
* Or, for any purpose than showing liability or impeaching a witness
	* So not for showing witness bias or prejudice
		* Because accuracy is important, and eliminating bias helps accuracy **AND** we're getting into unfair prejudice when bias is involved
	* Not to negate a contention of undue delay
		* Don't want parties to claim undue delay in bad faith when they've been involved in negotiation
* This exception to 408 applies to statements or conduct
	* But not to offers, acceptances, promises

#### 403
* If/when you lose on 408, there's always money in 403.
* Ppl bring 408 together with 403.

## September 10, 2013
* 409 (medical expenses) often comes up in 408 discussions.
* **409** excludes payment and offers to pay medical expenses for the purposes of showing liability
* Incentivizes paying med. exp.
* Risk of unfair prejudice
* Promotes biz interests
* Promotes settlement
* Key phrases
	* Furnishing, promising to pay or offering to pay
		* Expansively interpreted.
		* No response from injured pty necessary
		* Admitting responsibility concurrently with offer is *not* excluded
	* Medical hospital or similar expenses
		* Rehab, rx costs, are med costs
		* Lost wages, property dmg aren't
	* To prove liability
		* Admissible for any other purpose
		* Fall-mart hypo: to negate claim that harm didn't occur
* 408: limited to "claims" and "compromise negotiations"
* 409: Applies to all situtations, no claim necessary
* 403 still applies as a backstop, as usual
	* But bc 409 is straightforward, it doesn't come up very often

## September 11, 2013
* 409 doesn't cover statements made along with payment of med exps, but those are often covered by 408

### 410 Plea Bargains
#### Rationale
* Almost 19/20 crim trials plead out.
* Asymmetrical bargaining power
	* A little less expansive than 408 to remedy this a little bit (∆ has more latitude than π)
* Crim pleas are even more prejudicial than civil settlements

#### Exceptions
* Doesn't apply to finalized guilty pleas
	* Or statements flowing from finalized guilty pleas (/occur during negotiations)
	* Mostly irrelevant exception, since what's mainly relevant is the fact of guilt
* Doesn't matter what purpose you want to intro ev for (liability, impeachment, bias, whatever)
	* Risk of prejudice is just too high.
* Statements made during police interrogations don't count (not negotiation)
	* AGK: Confessions are an unmitigated good
* If ∆ introduces a statement, ct can allow other statements in *fairness* to add context.
	* Factors:
		* How misleading is the statement w/o context
		* Other evidence in the case
		* Harm to ∆
	* Usually litigated in limine
* In a trial for perjury or false statement, statements can be introduced if ∆ made them:
	* under oath
	* on the record
	* **and** with counsel present

#### Opening
* Applies in civil or criminal case (410 follows the ∆ from case where he pleads to any future civ or crim case)
* Only applies to ev being introduced against ∆ (only the ∆ who entered the plea)

#### What's excluded?
* Guilty plea, later withdrawn:
	* ∆ can withdraw a plea anytime before judge accepts
	* b/w acceptance and sentencing w/ "fair & just reason"
		* Not impossible, but not easy
* Nolo contendre plea
	* Conede guilt just for sentencing purposes
	* No preclusion effect (since it didn't really establish guilt)
	* Nolos are rare b/c πs can ususally get a guilty plea
* Statements made during proceedings leading to either of the above
	* "proceeding" has a broad meaning: basically anytime π is involved
	* "statement" includes conduct (nodding, etc.)
* Statements during plea negotiations that don't result in a plea.
* Two steps to determining whether there are negotiations (vs just interrogation):
	* ∆ has to have an *actual subjective* expectation that he is negotiating a plea
	* That expectation has to be *reasonable*
* Factors suggesting negotiation:
	* Attorneys present
		* Really hard to say 410 applies when π isn't present
	* Charges already filed
	* Specific terms discussed
	* Gov't expressed interest in ∆'s offer
	* Absence of caveat statement
* Main factor is whether π is involved in discussion

#### Waiver
* Most USAs require ∆ waive 410 before discussing a plea
	* State attys *do not* always require this
* Allows gov't to enforce ∆s' promisies to cooperate
* But strips ∆ of 410 protections
* Cynical view: if there's no waiver, it's not a plea session

#### 403
* Either side can rely on 403 there.

## September 12, 2013
* Police can intentionally mislead suspects into thinking they're empowered to cut deals, but when suspect gives up info it's still just a confession

### Liabilty Insurance
* **Rule 411** Basically nobody can talk about liability insurance in the courtroom.
* Rationale:
	* Incentivize buying insurance
	* Low probative value & high unfair prejudice
		* Prejudice is more against ins cos, since juries assume they have deep pockets & it's no big deal to have them pay out
* What's liabilty insurance?
	* Compensates policyholder for specific kinds of damages that the policy holders owes to the injured party
* Can be introduced to show bias/prejudice, or agency, ownership, or control
* Again, 403 can keep it out even if an exception applies
