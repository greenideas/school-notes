# Evidence Summary
## Course Basics
### Types of evidence
* There are six basic kinds of evidence. Though this is not a legally recognized taxonomy, these are the ways practictioners describe evidence:
    1. **Oral testimony**
        * *Fact Witness* any person who testifies to the facts of the case. Eyewitnesses, people who overheard something, police officer who logged a piece of evidence, etc.
        * *Expert witness* uses specialized knowledge to interpret evidence and/or explain it to the jury. Doesn't need firsthand knowledge.
        * *Character witness* gives info about good or bad character of a party or witness. Doesn't need firsthand knowledge.
    2. **Real evidence**: Physical evidence that played a part in the controversy.
        * Must be authenticated
        * Jurors love it.
    3. **Documents** 
    4. **Demonstrative evidence** didn't play a role in the controversy. PPTs, dummies, a bag of powdered sugar
    5. **Stipulation**
    6. **Judicial Notice** Judge can declare a fact that is "generally known" or "can be accurately and readily determined"

### Circumstantial vs. Direct Evidence
* **Circumstantial evidence** is evidence that requires the fact-finder to infer a connection between the evidence and the disputed fact.
* **Direct evidence** requires no inference.
* Evidence requiring fewer inferences is more persuasive.

### The Federal Rules
* The federal rules of evidence[^fre] apply in most federal courts, and are the starting point for most states' evidentiary rules.

> **Rule 101**: States that the rules apply in US courts[^fre-101] 


> **Rule 1101**: **(a)** lists specific venues & proceedings in which the Rules apply. **(b)** states that the rules apply in civil, criminal, and contempt proceedings (except those in which the judge can act summarily); **(c)** The exceptions don't apply to the confidentiality rules, which always apply. **(d)** lists the venues where the rules specifically do not apply: preliminary hearings regarding admissibility, grand jury proceedings, and others (arraignment, sentencing, bail).[^fre-1101]

#### Policy
* Some reasons for having evidentiary rules:
    * Level the playing field between (non)wealthy litigants
    * Protect the jury from bad/misleading info
    * Protect socially important relationships (doctor-pt, attorney-client)
    * Reliability
    * Efficiency

### Structure of a Trial
There are twelve basic stages to a trial (more for criminal trials)

1. **pretrial motions/motions in limine**
    * motion to exclude/introduce evidence
    * let attys know what evidence will be allowed before trial starts so they can prepare their case
    * attys can make soph. legal arguments/submit briefs
    * doesn't happen in front of a jury & so doesn't prejudice the jury.
2. **jury selection (voir dire)**
3. **opening statements.**
    * ppl choose sides early on in a trial, before hearing all the facts
    * party w/ burden of proof goes first (prosecutor or π) so they get to establish a framework first
    * may include demonstrative ev.
4. **prosecutor/π case-in-chief**
    * all evidence, witnesses, etc. for prosecution.
    * afterward, ∆ usually moves for jmol or acquittal
5. **∆'s case-in-chief or case-in-defense**
    * ∆ sometimes won't present a case since prosecutor has a high bar & the case might be theirs to lose
6. **π's case-in-rebuttal**
    * π/pros introduces new ev./witnesses to rebut ∆'s case.
    * limited to rebutting ∆'s case
7. **∆'s case in rebuttal or case-in-rejoinder**
    * limited to addressing π's rebuttal
8. **more rebuttal/rejoinder** (at judge's discretion)
9. **Closing Statements**
10. **Jury instruction**
11. **Deliberation**
12. **Verdict**

### Objections
* Rule 103 governs when a ruling of the evidence may be an issue on appeal.

> **Rule 103** **(a)** Error has to be preserved with 1) a *timely* 2) *specific* objection **AND** 2) affect a substantial right to raise it on appeal. **(b)** If the court's ruling is definitive and on the record, the party objecting doesn't need to renew the objection (but should). **(c)** The court can get the basis of a proffer through Q-and-A. **(d)** The judge must keep indamissible evidence away from the jury **(e)** The court has discretion to note plain error, even if the error claim wasn't preserved.[^fre-103]

[^fre-103]: http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_103

* If, on appeal, the court determines there was error, but that it didn't affect a substantial right, then that error is "harmless"

> **Rule 105** If evidence was improperly introduced, the judge **must** restrict its use and give limiting instructions to the jury.[^fre-105]

## Relevance
> **Rule 401** Evidence is relevant if **(a)** it *has any tendency* to make any fact more or less likely; **AND (b)** the fact is *of consequence* to the controversy.[^fre-401]

* Whether or not a fact is relevant may depend on the other facts in evidence at the time, and on both parties' theories of the case. As new facts are admitted or old facts are excluded, and as theories change, evidence can become (ir)relevant that was not before.
* A fact may be of consquence if it is the ultimate proposition, or if it is a link in the chain to establishing the ultimate proposition.

> **Rule 402** All and only relevant evidence is admissible (unless barred by another Rule, statute, the Constitution, or SCOTUS)[^fre-402]

When determining relevance, ask these questions:

* **Theory of the case**
    * π
    * ∆
* **Fit b/w evidence and theory**
    * Fit w/ moving party
    * Damage to party trying to exclude it
* **Admissibility/Exclusion**
    * Best argument
        * Admit?
            * Opposition
            * Reply
        * Exclude?
            * Opposition
            * Reply
    * Secondary argument
        * Admit?
            * Opposition
            * Reply
        * Exclude?
            * Opposition
            * Reply
* **Limiting instruction**
    * Limited purpose
