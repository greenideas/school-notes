# Federal Income Taxation
## Chapter 1: Introduction
* Taxation allocates the burden of collective activities

### Economic Consequences of Taxation
* **Income Effects** changes in behavior from having less money due to taxation
* **Substitution Effects** changes in behavior due to shifting attractiveness of alternative goods or activities
* The complexity of tax law is due to attempts to (de)incentivize different kinds of econ. activity

### History
* *Pollock v. Farmer's Loan & Trust* (1895): SCOTUS ruled fed. inc. tax unconst'l.
* 16A gave congress the power to "lay & collect taxes" w/o apportionment by population

### Theory & Policy
* Efficiency vs. "ability to pay"
	* Ability to pay doesn't == liquidity
	* "Endowent" or "wage rate" is the opportunity to earn wealth regardless of whether it's exercised

#### What to tax?
* Income? Consumption? Wealth?
* Haig-Simons def. of income: Income = Consumption + Change in Wealth
* Andrews, "cash-flow consumption tax": Deduction for savings & tax any withdrawal from savings
	* IRA: contributions are deductible, and withdrawals are subject to taxation as income

#### Tax Expenditure Budget
* Tax benefits == subsidies

#### Tax Incidence
* Econ. burden of a tax
* Mfrs can shift burden of taxes on goods they produce to consumers by raising prices
* No tax shifting in inc. tax.

### Terminology
* Tax base: items to be taxed
	* Tax base under system of fed. inc. tax is taxable income
* [§61](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/61) defines **gross income** (specific kinds of income are listed in §§[71-90](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-A/chapter-1/subchapter-B/part-II) and items excluded are listed in §§[101-140](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-A/chapter-1/subchapter-B))
	* Not rooted in any economic notion of income
* [§62](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/62) defines **adjusted gross income**: deduct personal exemptions + std. deduction or itemized deductions
	* §262(a) personal expenses are not deductible
* Tax is calculated by finding AGI on the rate schedule, then applying any credits & determining whether AMT must apply
	* AMT: 26% of first $175k and 28% on the rest
* Capital gain: gain from sale or exchange of capital asset

#### Tax accounting
* Cash method: Income when money is received, and deductible when money is paid
* Accrual method: Income when money is earned (regardless of whether it's received) and deductible when an obligation to pay is incurred
	* Most ppl use cash method & most biz uses accrual
* Captial expenditures: not deducted when outlay is made, but when the asset is used, sold, or abandoned (even on cash method).
	* Portion of a capital expenditure can be deducted every year as depreciation (**ACRS deduction—accelerated cost recovery system**)
* Accounting has to be done every year. Money earned in one year that isn't paid till the next is taxed in the year in which it's paid

#### Realization & Recognition
* Gain/loss is **realized** when it has to be accounted for for tax purposes (i.e. an asset is sold)
* Gain/loss is **recognized** when there's no provision to say it shouldn't be.
* Not all g/l that is realized is recognized, but all g/l that is recognized has to have been realized.

#### Recovery of Cost
* Costs incurred through buying goods to sell must be recovered before gains are taxable
* Costs incurred through buying capital goods are taxable immediately and are only offset by depreciation/cost recovery

#### Entities
* **Sole proprietor** owns a business by herself. The business's income & expenses are attributed to the SP.
* **Partnership** has two or more co-owners. Each partner pays their pro rata share based on the partnership agreement ("pass-through" taxation—the partnership is a "conduit" for taxing the partners)
	* A **Tax shelter** is an investment that creates a bigger loss for tax purposes than the actual economic loss. The partners use the loss to offset income from other sources.
* **Trust** is a device by which one person (trustee) holds property for someone else (beneficiary). Also creates a conduit.
* **Corporation** separate taxpaying entity from ppl who work there
	* Corps pay income to shareholders through dividends.
	* Increased share price is unrealized value until the shares are sold
	* Shareholders don't get a share of loss
 
### Average vs. Marginal Tax Rates
* **Progressive**: rate increases with income.
* **Regressive**: rate *decreases* with income
* **Proportional**: rate is constant as a proportion of income
* US income & corp taxes are progressive, but payroll (for social insurance) & excise taxes are regressive
* **Marginal tax rates** apply differently at different increments of income.
* Marginal rates have incentive effects

### Taxable Units and the Marriage Penalty
* 4 rate schedules for 4 kinds of taxable unit:
	1. Married couple filing jointly (also "surviving spouses")(*most favorable*)
	2. Head of household (unmarried person w/ live-in dependent)
	3. Unmarried individual
	4. Married people filing separate returns (*least favorable*)
* Two married people who make roughly the same income are hit with a **marriage penalty** since more of their aggregate income is taxed at a higher marginal rate.

### Deferral and its Value
* When interest rates are positive, deferring tax liability to another year benefits TP.
* **Rule of 72**: an amount will double in the number of years equal to 72 divided by the interest rate

## Chapter 2: Some Characteristics of Income
* Haig-Simons def of income wd include unrealized mkt gains & maybe even value of leisure

### Noncash benefits
* §61 (& §1.61-1(a))def of gross income doesn't distinguish b/w (non)cash benefits
* Not taxing noncash benefits would encourage noncash payment, which would favor some jobs/industries/sectors over others, and would create inefficiencies in the labor market.
* But enforcement of IRC around noncash benefits is difficult

>  if property is transferred by an employer to an employee or if property is transferred to an independent contractor, as compensation for services, for an amount less than its fair market value, then regardless of whether the transfer is in the form of a sale or exchange, the difference between the amount paid for the property and the amount of its fair market value at the time of the transfer is compensation and shall be included in the gross income of the employee or independent contractor.

#### Meals & Lodging Provided to Employees
* *Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner* (1929) - Employer's payment of employee's income tax is itself income.
* Benaglia v. Commissioner: BTA case holding that employee's lodging & food weren't income so long as they *primarily* benefitted the employer
* [**§119(a)**](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/119 "26 USC § 119 - Meals or lodging furnished for the convenience of the employer | Title 26 - Internal Revenue Code | U.S. Code | LII / Legal Information Institute") replaced this common law rule & states that:
	* meals can only be excluded if they are served on the employer's premises
	* lodging can only be excluded if it's on premises and living there is a condition of employment.
* Lots of litigation about basic terms in this statute:
	* Cases go both ways on whether "meals" includes include groceries selected from employer's commissary
	* "convenience of the employer" means biz interests—not just compensatory interest for securing an employee's service
* **§119(b)(4)**: Furnished meals are only excludable if they're furnished to > half of employees.
* [**119-1(a)**](http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.119-1 "26 CFR 1.119-1 - Meals and lodging furnished for the convenience of the employer. | Title 26 - Internal Revenue | Code of Federal Regulations | LII / Legal Information Institute") meals are excludable if they're: 1) provided on premises; and 2) furnished for employer's benefit
	* Limited time for lunch break,
	* On emergency call
	* Shift meal before or after shift

### Other Fringe Benefit Statutes
* Some FBs were excluded through act or omission: parking, flights, health ins.
* [**132**](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/132 "26 USC § 132 - Certain fringe benefits | Title 26 - Internal Revenue Code | U.S. Code | LII / Legal Information Institute") makes a lot of FBs excludable
	* No add'l cost svcs (free standby flights for airline employees (and their parents! **§132(h)(3)**))
	* Discounts on goods employer sells
	* working condition (company car, free journal subscriptions)
	* de minimis fringes (incl meals if served on premises and employer doens't make money from selling food §132(e)(2))
	* transportation (transit passes, parking) §131(f)
	* moving expenses
	* retirement planning
	* on-premises gym
* Job has to relate to the line of biz where benefit is given: Can't get discount on Virgin phone service *and* free standby flights on Virgin planes
* [**1.61-21(b)**](http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.61-21 "26 CFR 1.61-21 - Taxation of fringe benefits. | Title 26 - Internal Revenue | Code of Federal Regulations | LII / Legal Information Institute"): valuation of FBs.
	* Incl. fair market value
* Cafeteria plan: employees can pick among benefits or take a cash equivalent. Expressly authorized by §125.
* Have to be "use it or lose it"
* Frequent flyer miles: though clearly a FB, too hard to value, so IRS threw in the towel & said they wouldn't count as income or taxable FBs.
* Employer deduction: If a FB is too hard to value, the IRS might deny the employer a deduction to make up for lost revenue from the employees.
* Benefits from other than the employer (review copies of books, etc.) are income if sold or if donated to charity and claimed as a deduction
* [**§162(a)**](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/162 "26 USC § 162 - Trade or business expenses | Title 26 - Internal Revenue Code | U.S. Code | LII / Legal Information Institute"): Biz expenses may be deductible

### Health Insurance
* [**§106(a)**](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/106 "26 USC § 106 - Contributions by employer to accident and health plans | Title 26 - Internal Revenue Code | U.S. Code | LII / Legal Information Institute") Health Insurance provded by an employer is excluded from gross income
* This usually causes employees to "trade up" on their health plan

###  Valuating FBs
#### Turner v. Commissioner
* How much of steamship tickets should π declare as income?
* π declared $520, but ∆ said it should be $2200 (retail price)
* π traded the two first-class tix (plus $12.50) for 4 tourist tickets
* Tix weren't transferrable & π didn't want/intend to purchase them, so they were worth less than FMV. 
	* Still, there was substantial benefit. Let's call it $1400 worth.
* Taxing the fan who catches the ball
