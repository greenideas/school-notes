# Income Tax Class Notes
## August 26, 2013

* What is income?
* Goal of inc. tax is to raise revenue.
* Capitation would be more efficient, but equity prevents such a tax.
* Income represents a measure of an individual's ability to pay.
* Ability to pay: Increase in econ power over a year
	* Haig-Simons def of econ power: consumption + change in net worth
	* Y = C + ∆W

* Taxable Income x Rate = Tax
* Tax - Credits = Tax owed
* Tax owed - Tax withheld = Refund/check
* Consumption = Personal living/family expenses (rent, food, clothing, recreation)
* Income is *generally* consumption + change in savings.
* For a business owner, money spent to generate income is not itself income.
* Econ enrichment (how much wealth is added to the TP—not just cash) - Biz deductions/outlays => taxable income of a biz
* Gross income is the econ. enrichment
* **§61** lists kinds of gross income
	* **Exclusions** are benefits to TP that are not counted in GI (*unrealized* gains from property txns, gifts, inheritance, int. on muni bonds, etc.)
	* Exclusions can have incentive effects. We exclude employer 401(k) contributions to encourage employers to contribute.
	* Substitution effects: $100 vs. $100 heath ins. premium. HI isn't taxable, so it's more of a benefit.
* Gross income (- exclusions) - §62(a) Deductions = AGI
* §62(a) deductions also called "above the line"
* Deductions: 
	1. Some outlays
	2. Realized losses
* Deductions vs. exclusions: Exclusions are part of determining GI. Deductions are substracted from GI when it's already calcluated in order to figure out AGI.
* Some ppl see AGI as a better approx of real econ wealth, and we deduct some consumption from *that*
	* Rsns for AGI on p. 32 n57.
* AGI - (Itemized deductions + Personal exemptions) = Taxable income
* Itemized deductions (Schedule A)
	* Extraordinary med. exp.
	* Charitable contrib
	* Mortgage Interest
* TP can itemize if doing so would give > std. deduction.
* 2011 std. deduction is $11,900 (so no tax if you make < that)
* Personal exemption is $3800 (* ppl eligible to be exempted)
* Above the line deductions are better since they help you pay less tax regardless of whatever you itemize. That is to say, you can get an above the line deduction along with the standard deduction.
* Credits come dollar for dollar off of your tax bill, and so are better than deductions of the same amount.
* Credits vs. deductions: Credits come right off of what you owe, rather than just reducing your AGI to determine *what* you owe.
* Deductions have greater value at higher marginal rates. Credits give everyone the same offset regardless of their bracket.
* Some credits are refundable (EIC)

## August 28, 2013
* Tax expenditure: policy initiative implemented through the tax code
	* e.g. mortgage interest deduction (gov't gives up $94.1B by allowing the deduction)
* TEs have unintended consequences
	* MID encourages movement out of cities
	* Not taxing employer health benefits encourages wasteful "Cadillac plans"	
* TEs make the tax code more complex and increase adminstrative costs
* Sked C: P&L (biz expenses)(Above the line)
* Sked A: Itemized deductions  (below the line)

### Tax Rates
* Horizontal equity: we want ppl in the same econ situation to pay the same in taxes
* Vertical equity: how we treat ppl at the top of the income scale vs. how we treat ppl at the bottom
* Progressive tax system: rate increases with income (US income tax)
* Flat tax: same rate across the board
* Regressive tax system: proportion of income paid decreases with income (sales tax, social security)
* Arguments for progressivity
	* Marginal utility of a dollar decreases with income (pain theory)
	* Social value of redistribution
* Arguments against
	* Disincentive to work
	* Encourages holding onto resources (rather than sell them & be taxed on the proceeds), which is inefficient
* Marginal rate: the rate at which the last dollar earned is taxed
* Effective rate: total income/total tax 
* The higher your income, the closer your effective rate will be to your marginal rate (although they can never be ==)
* Marginal rate determines the subjective value of the next dollar you earn

### Capital Gains
* Capital gains/losses
	* Long-term capital gains are subject to lower rates
	* Long-term capital losses are subject to lower deductibility
* Ordinary inc. v. cap gains
	* Cap gains:
		* From sale or exchange of an asset (i.e. not compensation, not interest, not rental income) (some special kinds of inc. are cap gains, e.g. dividend income)
		* The asset has to be a capital asset (mostly investment assets: stocks, property held as an investment, personal use assets)
		* Holding period: if > 1 year, it's long-term
	* Long-term cap gains are subject to lower ratest than ord. inc.
* Sked D: Cap gains & losses
	* Add cap gains on top of ord. inc. If it would be in the 10-15% brackets, no tax. If it would be in 25-35%, it's taxed at 15%. If it would be in the 36.5% bracket, it's taxed at 20%.
	* Significant preferential rate over ord. inc.
* Incentive effects of TE and tax preferences
	* If you get $1000 cash from your employer, it might only be worth about $700 to you after taxes. If you get a $1000 health plan, you get the all of that value because of tax expenditures.
	* If you have $1000 that you might use to pay rent, the gov't will $300 of tax on top of that, b/c rent isn't deductible. If you spend that $1000 on mortgage interest, the gov't won't take that $300 in tax.

### Present Value & Deferral
* Employee gets $300 of stock
* Basis: cost or investment in property.
* §1001(a): Gain is the amt realized from sale less the adjusted basis (according to §1011).
* 1.61-2(d)(2)(i): Once you've included an amount in income, it becomes part of basis.
* Splitting income over different years or different TPs in a family keeps the marginal rate down.
* Benefit of deferring a tax liability depends on the present value of the amount owed.
