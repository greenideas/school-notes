# Income Tax Class Notes
## August 26, 2013
* What is income?
* Goal of inc. tax is to raise revenue.
* Capitation would be more efficient, but equity prevents such a tax.
* Income represents a measure of an individual's ability to pay.
* Ability to pay: Increase in econ power over a year
	* Haig-Simons def of econ power: consumption + change in net worth
	* Y = C + ∆W

## August 27, 2013
* Taxable Income x Rate = Tax
* Tax - Credits = Tax owed
* Tax owed - Tax withheld = Refund/check
* Consumption = Personal living/family expenses (rent, food, clothing, recreation)
* Income is *generally* consumption + change in savings.
* For a business owner, money spent to generate income is not itself income.
* Econ enrichment (how much wealth is added to the TP—not just cash) - Biz deductions/outlays => taxable income of a biz
* Gross income is the econ. enrichment
* **§61** lists kinds of gross income
	* **Exclusions** are benefits to TP that are not counted in GI (*unrealized* gains from property txns, gifts, inheritance, int. on muni bonds, etc.)
	* Exclusions can have incentive effects. We exclude employer 401(k) contributions to encourage employers to contribute.
	* Substitution effects: $100 vs. $100 heath ins. premium. HI isn't taxable, so it's more of a benefit.
* Gross income (- exclusions) - §62(a) Deductions = AGI
* §62(a) deductions also called "above the line"
* Deductions: 
	1. Some outlays
	2. Realized losses
* Deductions vs. exclusions: Exclusions are part of determining GI. Deductions are substracted from GI when it's already calcluated in order to figure out AGI.
* Some ppl see AGI as a better approx of real econ wealth, and we deduct some consumption from *that*
	* Rsns for AGI on p. 32 n57.
* AGI - (Itemized deductions + Personal exemptions) = Taxable income
* Itemized deductions (Schedule A)
	* Extraordinary med. exp.
	* Charitable contrib
	* Mortgage Interest
* TP can itemize if doing so would give > std. deduction.
* 2011 std. deduction is $11,900 (so no tax if you make < that)
* Personal exemption is $3800 (* ppl eligible to be exempted)
* Above the line deductions are better since they help you pay less tax regardless of whatever you itemize. That is to say, you can get an above the line deduction along with the standard deduction.
* Credits come dollar for dollar off of your tax bill, and so are better than deductions of the same amount.
* Credits vs. deductions: Credits come right off of what you owe, rather than just reducing your AGI to determine *what* you owe.
* Deductions have greater value at higher marginal rates. Credits give everyone the same offset regardless of their bracket.
* Some credits are refundable (EIC)

## August 28, 2013
* Tax expenditure: policy initiative implemented through the tax code
	* e.g. mortgage interest deduction (gov't gives up $94.1B by allowing the deduction)
* TEs have unintended consequences
	* MID encourages movement out of cities
	* Not taxing employer health benefits encourages wasteful "Cadillac plans"	
* TEs make the tax code more complex and increase adminstrative costs
* Sked C: P&L (biz expenses)(Above the line)
* Sked A: Itemized deductions  (below the line)

### Tax Rates
* Horizontal equity: we want ppl in the same econ situation to pay the same in taxes
* Vertical equity: how we treat ppl at the top of the income scale vs. how we treat ppl at the bottom
* Progressive tax system: rate increases with income (US income tax)
* Flat tax: same rate across the board
* Regressive tax system: proportion of income paid decreases with income (sales tax, social security)
* Arguments for progressivity
	* Marginal utility of a dollar decreases with income (pain theory)
	* Social value of redistribution
* Arguments against
	* Disincentive to work
	* Encourages holding onto resources (rather than sell them & be taxed on the proceeds), which is inefficient
* Marginal rate: the rate at which the last dollar earned is taxed
* Effective rate: total income/total tax 
* The higher your income, the closer your effective rate will be to your marginal rate (although they can never be ==)
* Marginal rate determines the subjective value of the next dollar you earn 

## August 29, 2013
### Capital Gains
* Capital gains/losses
	* Long-term capital gains are subject to lower rates
	* Long-term capital losses are subject to lower deductibility
* Ordinary inc. v. cap gains
	* Cap gains:
		* From sale or exchange of an asset (i.e. not compensation, not interest, not rental income) (some special kinds of inc. are cap gains, e.g. dividend income)
		* The asset has to be a capital asset (mostly investment assets: stocks, property held as an investment, personal use assets)
		* Holding period: if > 1 year, it's long-term
	* Long-term cap gains are subject to lower ratest than ord. inc.
* Sked D: Cap gains & losses
	* Add cap gains on top of ord. inc. If it would be in the 10-15% brackets, no tax. If it would be in 25-35%, it's taxed at 15%. If it would be in the 36.5% bracket, it's taxed at 20%.
	* Significant preferential rate over ord. inc.
* Incentive effects of TE and tax preferences
	* If you get $1000 cash from your employer, it might only be worth about $700 to you after taxes. If you get a $1000 health plan, you get the all of that value because of tax expenditures.
	* If you have $1000 that you might use to pay rent, the gov't will $300 of tax on top of that, b/c rent isn't deductible. If you spend that $1000 on mortgage interest, the gov't won't take that $300 in tax.

### Present Value & Deferral
* Employee gets $300 of stock
* Basis: cost or investment in property.
* §1001(a): Gain is the amt realized from sale less the adjusted basis (according to §1011).
* 1.61-2(d)(2)(i): Once you've included an amount in income, it becomes part of basis.
* Splitting income over different years or different TPs in a family keeps the marginal rate down.
* Benefit of deferring a tax liability depends on the present value of the amount owed.

## September 3, 2013
### Present value cont'd
* IRAs are one way the IRS lets you defer tax liability.
* Two variables: 1) length of time; 2) discount rate
* PV of $100 to be paid in 5 years at 3% interest is 100 * .863 = $86.30
* As length of time or the interest rate increases, PV decreases (you have to invest less to get to the target amount at the end)
* Depreciation is another way to give the benefit of deferral, since the amount you can deduct each year, it reduces the tax you pay when you sell the asset since you can invest the amount you deduct.

### Fringe Benefits
* Money paid by the employer for the benefit of the employee, it's essentially compensation

## September 4, 2013
* FBs included *unless* you can find a specific exclusion
* §119, §132, §1.132-1
* Tax regs are promulgated by Treasury.
	* Not law, since they're not passed by congress
	* But have strong precedential value
	* Moreso when a law says "IRS shall create implementing regs"
* Alt. rule suggested by Benaglia dissent: include the cost to live & eat elsewhere.
* Whether §119 applies is a fact question
* §132: other FBs
	* No additional cost:§132(b)
		* Offered by emp'er to emp'ee
		* Service
		* Svc offered for sale to customers
		* In the line of biz in which the emp'ee works
		* no add'l cost to emp'er (incl. foregone revenue)
		* not offered on a discrim. basis
	* *Qualified* employee discounts §132(c)(1)
		* Goods: gross profit percentage
		* services: 20% off full freight
	* De Minimis §1.132-6
	* Working condition

## September 5, 2013
* If an in-kind benefit *isn't* excluded, it's usually taxed at FMV.
* Discrimination rule, 132(j)(1): The §132(a)(2)-(2) only apply to highly compensated employees if they're available to all employees.
* §132(c)(2)(A) Gross profit percentage = (i) / (ii) = (Price - Cost)/ Price
* 1.132-3(e): Excess discount beyond what's excludable can be taxed.
* Working condition
* 1.132-6(d)(2): Occasional meal money, cab fare
* 1.132-7 URLs was de minimis if Y! covered their costs.
* 132(j)(4) on-premisis gym is excludable
* Working condition:
	* Emp'er pays for something on behalf of emp'ee, and emp'ee would've been able to deduct it if she paid for it herself, then emp'er can exclude it.
	* Expenses incurred in the course of business. §162
	* Makes more sense after studying §67

## September 9, 2013
### Prizes 
* Presumption that FMV of prize is includable
* Glenshaw Glass:
	* Income is any gain of wealth that is realized over which TP has dominion
		* Even if it didn't come through labor, investment, or capital gain
* **§74** prizes & windfalls are includable
* Customary deviations: things that are excludable in practice, even though there's technically no exclusion (frequent flier miles, extreme home makeover)

### Imputed Income
* Consumption isn't covered in the gross income formula b/c there's no observable market transaction
* Ppl paying high marginal rates benefit more from excluding imputed income because at those high marginal rates, they get more benefit from each dollar they can exclude

## September 10, 2013
* 1.61-1(a) services received are included in gross income when 
* **RR 79-24**
	* Normally, value the artist creates in creating art are not taxable (sweat equity)
	* But once the artist uses the property to pay off a debt, the gain on the property is taxable

### Gifts	
* Mom earns $100k, gives $30k to son. 3 alternatives for taxing:
	1. S has $30k of income, M deducts $30k (GI is $70k)
	2. S has $30k, M has $100k
		* Not nececssarily unfair. Unlike §162, in that M isn't using the 30k to generate revenue
	3. S gets no income, M deducts nothing.
		* Administratively easiest, and generates more revenue than (1) since more is taxed at a higher MR.
* Part of how we resolve questions like this is whether we look at M&S as an economic unit.
* **§162** Employers can deduct costs of earning money, incl. wages paid out

### Procedure
* TP doesn't pay, can't pay IRS assessement, goes to tax ct.
* Tax ct. 1 judge, no juries.
* Alternatively, you can pay the tax and sue in dist. ct.

### Duberstein
* D said the car was a gift, not GI
* IRS said it was income
* Tax ct agrees
* Ct. App. said it was a gift
* SCOTUS
	* If the std for gifts is generous impulse, then this can't be a gift (since Berman deducted the cost of the Caddy as a biz expense)
	* Absence of legal or moral obligation doesn't nec. mean gift.
	* Not a gift if given for services rendered or expected to be rendered in the future.
	* Depends on donor's intent.
		* Donor's labeling isn't dispositive
	* Congressional intent was to bar $ being both excluded and deducted as a biz expense.

## September 11, 2013
* The same money can't be both deducted and excluded.
	* *Stanton*: e'er-e'ee
	* *Duberstein*: informal nonemployment
	* Formal nonemployment (ind. contractor)
		* Payor might have an obligation to report payment to IRS, but doesn't have to give payee W2, withhold taxes, etc.

### Employer-Employee
* §162: Payment is made in conj. with trade or biz.

#### Employee
* Presumption is that e'ee must include
	* Unless
		* Exclusion
			* §102(c): 132 can apply, because some incentive bonus or de minimis fringes may be excludable
		* Child/family

#### Employer
* §162 Is the expeniture made in conj. with trade or biz.?
* Some FBs (e.g. health insurance (for policy reasons), de minimis fringes (for administrative reasons)), even if excluded to the e'ee, can also be deducted by e'er.

### Independent Contractor
#### Payor
* If payment is compensation for services, it's deductible §274(b)
* 274(b) never applies to limit an e'er deduction since an e'er can't give a gift (unless it's an employee-relatative)
	* Limits how much of a gift can be deducted to $25.

## September 12, 2013
### Basis of Gifts
* Tax consequences of gift of property when the property is subsequently sold.
* 61(a)(3) includes gains from property txns in GI
	* (i.e. after a realization event, like a sale)
* 1001(a) G&L are computed by comparing the amount realized with the basis
* 1011 basis is essentially cost
* If there's a realized gain, the presumption is that it's included
	* Intermediate step: Is the gain recognized?
		* 1001(c) entire amount realized shall be recognized unless there's a specific nonrecognition rule
* Is the character of the gain capital gain? if so, long/short term?
* Same for loss.
	* Is it realized? Recognized? ("sustained" in 165(a))
	* Is it allowed? There has to be a specific section that allows the loss to be deducted (this is different from gains)
		* 165(a) allowed losses are not compensated by insurance
		* Allowed losses are generally above the line
		* 165(c) limited to losses from biz or trade, or from profit-seeking, or from property loss due to casualty
			* Allowed: stock losses, loss on sale of mfg plant
			* Not allowed: Selling your car at a loss. Presumption is that you *consumed* the value.

#### Taft v. Bowers
* Treating the donee the same way as the donor is just the way that congress is able to collect income tax. It's not a tax on the donee's property
* Taxing donees for their realized gains on sale (instead of taxing it as income when the gift is received) allows the donee to defer the tax and invest it (maybe save the money to pay the tax)

#### 1015
* 7701(a)(42) Substituted basis ("carryover basis") is the basis the donor conveys along with the gift.
* We're never going to tax the donee's gain unless it's more than the donor's basis
	* And we're never going to allow her a loss if she sells it for more than then FMV at time of transfer
	* So if she sells it for more than FMV but less than the donor's basis, no loss and no gain
