## Income
### Gross Income

> **26 USC §61 — Gross Income Defined** Lists many kinds of income that are part of gross income: primarily compensation for services, business income, and investment income[^26-usc-61]

* A longer list of items included in gross income is found in **§§71-90**[^26-usc-71-90]
* Some kinds of income are **excluded** from gross income (such as unrealized gains from property, gifts, inheritance etc. Listed in **§§101-140**[^26-usc-101-140]).
    * Exclusions can be used to create incentives (e.g. excluding employer 401(k) contributions)
* Gains from property transactions are only counted in gross income when they are **realized**.(**§1001(a)**[^26-usc-1001])
    * A gain realized from a property transaction is the amount received in payment less the **adjusted basis** of the property (i.e. the unrecovered investment **§§1011-1016**[^26-usc-1011-1016])
    * Realized gains are only included in gross income when they are **recognized**, which they always are unless a specific **nonrecognition rule** applies.**§1001(c)**[^26-usc-1001]
    * When any gain from property has been previously included in income, it becomes part of the basis. **§1.61-2(d)(2)(i)**[^26-cfr-1.61-2]
* Income generally: amount consumed + change in wealth.

### Adjusted Gross Income

> **26 USC §62 – Adjusted Gross Income** is a taxpayer's gross income minus the amounts deductible under §62(a).[^26-usc-62]

* §62(a) deductions are called "above the line" deductions since they are part of the computation of AGI. 
    * ATL deductions are preferable to below the line since they are deductible no matter how much you make. Below the line deductions may not apply as you make more money.

### Taxable Income

> **26 USC §63 – Taxable income** is AGI - (personal exemptions + the greater of itemized or the std deduction)[^26-usc-63]

* Personal exemptions may be allowed for the taxpayer and for certain members of the TP's household.**§151**[^26-usc-151]
* The standard deduction allows low- to low-middle-income taxpayers to take a deduction without having to keep track of expenses.
* Itemized deductions include many things (depreciation of capital assets, home mortgage interest, etc.)

### Tax Rates
* Tax rates are set out in **§1(a)-(d)**[^26-usc-1]
* The §1 rates are **progressive**: they increase with income
* A TP's **marginal rate** is the rate they pay on the last dollar of income (i.e. the highest rate)
* A TP's **effective rate** is the average rate paid (i.e. total taxable income / total amount paid)

#### Capital Gains
* A **capital gain** is gain achieved through the sale of a capital asset (stock, investment property, personal use assets).
* Any capital asset held for >1 year is a long-term asset.
    * Long-term captial gains are taxed at a lower rate than short-term.
* Use **Form 1040, Schedule D** to compute rates for capital gains and losses:
    * Add cap gains on top of ord. inc. If it would be in the 10-15% brackets, no tax. If it would be in 25-35%, it's taxed at 15%. If it would be in the 36.5% bracket, it's taxed at 20%.

#### Marriage Penalty
* Two-income married couples will pay more in taxes than the two TPs would pay if they were single. 
    * A single-income family gets a **marriage benefit** since the one earner pays less than (s)he would filing as an individual.
    * The two-income family incurs a **marriage penalty** since each half of the couple is not able to benefit from the progressivity of the tax rates.

#### Tax Credits
* Credits are dollar-for-dollar reductions in tax liability (e.g. credit for employer withholding **§31**[^26-usc-31]).
    * Whereas a $1000 *deduction* would reduce the tax liability of a TP with 35% marginal rate by $350, a $1000 *credit* would reduce the same TP's tax liability by $1000.
* When a TP's credits > their tax liability, (s)he gets a refund check.

### Present Value and Deferral
* A dollar received today is worth more than one received tomorrow, and a $1 tax liability deferred for a year is lower than a $1 liability paid now.
    * This is because a dollar received today (or a dollar not yet paid out) can earn interest.
* Determine present value of a future liability or the future value of a present amount based on the interest rate (discount rate) and the number of years.
* Gain or loss from selling property is the amount realinzed minus the adjusted basis. **§1001(a)**[^26-usc-1001], **§1.1001-1(a)**[^26-cfr-1.1001-1]
* **Realization**: Exchange for cash or "exchange of property for other property differing materially either in kind or in extent" **§1.1001-1(a)**.
* When realized gain is of a like kind, it is not recognized.**§1031(a)**[^26-usc-1031]
* As length of time or the interest rate increases, PV decreases (you have to invest less to get to the target amount at the end)

### Noncash Benefits
* **§61** doesn't distinguish b/w cash & noncash income.
* **§ 1.61–2**[^26-cfr-1.61-2]: When goods are sold for less than fair market value, the difference is income.

[^26-cfr-1.61-2]: http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.61-2

#### Meals & Lodging
* **§119**[^26-usc-119]: Meals and lodging provided by employer may be excluded if: 
    * food is served on premises 
    * lodging is a requirement for the job
* "convenience of the employer" means biz interests—not just compensatory interest for securing an employee's service
* **§119** replaced the *Benaglia* rule that M&L were excludable if they were primarily for emp'ee's benefit. 

[^26-usc-119]: http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/119

#### Other Fringe Benefits
* **§132**[^26-usc-132] makes a lot of FBs excludable
    * No add'l cost svcs (free standby flights for airline employees (and their parents! **§132(h)(3)**))
    * Qualified discounts on goods employer sells
    * working condition (company car, free journal subscriptions)
        * Emp'er pays for something on behalf of emp'ee, and emp'ee would've been able to deduct it if she paid for it herself, then emp'er can exclude it.
        * Expenses incurred in the course of business. **§162**[^26-usc-162]
    * de minimis fringes (incl meals if served on premises and employer doens't make money from selling food **§132(e)(2)**) **§1.132-6**[^26-cfr-1.132-6]
    * transportation (transit passes, parking) **§132(f)**
    * moving expenses
    * retirement planning
    * on-premises gym **132(j)(4)**
* Qualified employee discounts (**§1.132-3**)[^26-cfr-1.123-3] require:
    * Goods: discount not to exceed gross profit percentage
        * **§132(c)(2)(A)** *Gross profit percentage* = (i) / (ii) = (Price - Cost)/ Price
    * Services to be discounted by no more than 20%
* If an in-kind benefit *isn't* excluded, it's usually taxed at FMV.
* Discrimination rule, **132(j)(1)**: §132(a)(1)-(2)(no additional cost, qualified employee discount) only apply to highly compensated employees if they're available to all employees.
* If only part of a benefit is excluded, the remainder is taxed **1.132-3(e)**
